obamacare is a hazard for all hard-working americans. so now add trader joe's to agrowing list of company changing the worker healthcare due to obamacare and many others are cutting hours. this is not what we were promised. i remember hearing it would bring healthcare to more workers. now it's fewer. >> it's destroying healthcare and also potential employment of the country. 43% of the small businesses said they delayed hiring because of obamacare. 20% cut employees. another 20% cut employee hours because of obamacare. we have mentioned a few of the companies there. seaworld, lands end, trader joe. circle-k. subway franchises, all over the country cutting the workers' hour, cutting workers because of obamacare. it's force. it's force applied to healthcare and also to employment. that's what even after all of this intervention we still have unemployment above 7%. it will stay there as we become a european style socialist state under obamacare. >> eric: smitty, one thing if you mess with my chalupa. taco bell may cut hours.wendy's also. but if you play around with companies like delta, ibm, kroger food, you are talking major employers. >> what bigger message can be sent to washington than private enterprise saying we can't afford it, we're taking it away. that is a primary concern in country right now is jobs. what is happening now is the retailers are going to have a tough time finding cheap labor. how many people do you know go get a job like working at trader joe's as a cashier just for the health benefits? that is going by the wayside. the retailers are going to have to start forking over a lot more money just to get through people through the door to work. >> eric: julie, it's all about the job. all about people looking for healthcare. >> so now the trader joe's employees will no longer have healthcare through trader joe's, but have the same amount of money. some pay less and some paymore. this will allow trader joe's to make more money. this is good for trader joe's and not bad for the employees. i don't understand. you are talking about, jonathan is talking about the massive free market is bad for businesses. this is great for trader joe's. they've opened dub >> eric: hold on. hold on. let's do this. point out that trader joe's gave a statement. telling us that 77% of the employee won't see a change, for the remaining trader joe's crew members working an average between 17.3 hours and 29.9 hours per week based on the calculator provide through healthcare.gov. we estimate over 70% of them will pay less for comparable insurance. >> thank you. thank you. >> eric: trader je's says 77% won't see a change. >> what is interesting to me, afl-cio convention they have in los angeles just this last week, you had two major guys, ed hill of the electrical worker union.terry o'sullivan of labor international. these guys came out against it. this is not from the right wing. this is because it's destroying jobs and the union people understand this just as well as the people who are employers. so the employers and the employees and people with a selfish best interest, this is not serving anyone's best interest. >> eric: i have to i gree with wayne. the unions are saying this isn't a good deal. >> i love that you are talk about the this as we had trader's joe the employer talking about that is great for is workers, great for them and their bottom line. i don't understand. you won't believe trader joe's. who are you going to believe? if you're going to always pick your mantra, i don't understand. trader joe's is saying it's great for trader joe's. >> it's easy to believe that -- [ overtalk ] >> eric: guys, guys. john. please. >> workers who are having their hours cut, the employers are cutting jobs.it's not great for any of those involved, julie. it's not great for the economy at large. obamacare is force. force is opposite of the wealth creation. you won't see new jobs created or major innovation under obamacare. this is a hindrance to free market needed in this country. a long list we provide, not indicktive of whadicktive -- inf what will happen under obamacare. >> you have 2200 pages of regulations. nobody can understand it. people are trying to. they go out and they are spending the taxpayer money to hire people. to explain it. the people who are hiring don't understand it and congress who voted on it never even read it. >> eric: they sold us the healthcare plan and said the estimate $938 billion. it's up to $1.8 trillion. troubled what they promised. >> showing that less people will be covered when it was promised that more people would be covered with healthinsurance. bottom line, the argument that trader joe's -- what might be good for trader joe's, according to the statement. this isn't reality yet. it hasn't been proven. might not be good for the other retailers or the other restaurants or the other grocers of the world. this could have a long-term hazardous efect the economy in this country and the job market right now. bottom line, that should be the concern of the government right now. that should be the concern of washington. no providing healthcare. >> if you are a large employer, major employer and the only people forced in the mandate are the large businesses, the vast majority 95% are not under this. but if you are a large business, one of two things. you either provide healthcare and you will continue to provide healthcare so nothing will effect you one way or another. if you decide to get rid of healthcare for the part-time workers those workers -- by the way, any worker could do it today. they are not mandate to keep employing anybody or keep give healthcare to anybody. those people now have a place to go. they have healthcare.>> the open arms of government saying c'mon, come to us. this is what we wanted. >> no, i mean -- [ overtalk ] >> eric: jonathan? >> if only large employers are affect how come half of the small employers say they delayed hiring because of obamacare? >> eric: let him finish. >> well, it's affecting their hiring potential and the way they run the business. it's affecting the economy overall. you only like to look at what you see the net benefit. you don't look at the cost. the cost is burdened not by the individuals but by the employers trying to create jobs. >> eric: we got to leave it there. this could go on for hours. coming up, obama versus putin over syria. is this stakes, high-stakes battle in the middle east more about the economic superpower than the military might?

you have six-pack abs. we have the strongest military in world, bar none. we know. that should about we get back to focus on the economic strength? >> thank you. to the energy king himself, let's focus on getting natural gas out of the ground here to liquefy it and sending it over to china. what are we doing here? we need to find out a way to make china dependent on us and convert their dollars to our dollars. >> eric: john, globally, we rank fifth now in 2007, 2008.we were first on global competitiveness. not only, that economic freedom. tenth. sliding on just about every economic metric against the rest of the world. there is not a difference in water and new york and pyongyang or new york and havana, cuba. that created a superpower status. it was before the federal reserve or the minimum wage. or superpower status is established before that. to get back to the status, return to principles and the ideals. with this president we are going in the opposite direction. >> we are getting it back on the economic feet. >> i'm not sure that it has that much to do with how youregistered with the rest of world. the peace of the world was main taped 1815 waterloo to 1914 world war i. but by people who understood balance of power. we have a problem in middle east. if we could play one of those people off the other, negotiate between one and the other. if we could recognize what the selfish best interest are and utilize that, instead of using the military power with a threat, that is what we need to do to position ourselves with the rest of the world. >> we tax our people two have, we tax have a lot and give have-not quiet a bit. we are sliding economically. is this a bad policy? should we guess back to capitalist society. >> if you look the countries,one, two, three. as much as we were or britain, that is why we slid from 2018 the crash. there is a great point. i will agree. we need a robust diplomacy. we need to play these people off of each other and do what is in our national interest. >> eric: let me do this. we rank 25th against the world. in reading, we are 12th. education society, economic freedom. we are heading the wrong direction. >> we need the fantastic schools to do a wonderful josh enkating the kid. they are much less restrictions, or how long congress or business friendly climb. that is not a country's natural resources or themilitary to create wealth. it's a principle. i don't know if you want to move away and go toward the european style socialism? they have 28% unemployment in greece. >> how did you know? how did you guess? >> what is the alternative? >> what is the alternative? move away from capitalism. you're putting words in my mouth. all i'm saying is you are agree with wayne and what everybody else is saying yes, we need to double the effort to get the economy back on track. >> when you do obamacare, it's a socialized medicine, is it not? >> well, it is. there are things that are -- obviously, we need to rejuvenate the economy. we only need, we have had 4-1/2 years of obama. we are still above 7% unemployment rate. 3 the facts. we have to deal with facts. rejuvenate the economy in many ways. yes, capitalism is something,because capital schism brings us freedom. we know that. we have to insist on that. at the same time, you have to use your selfish best interest in diplomacy to get the best you can out of it. the proof of that is in history. just read it. >> eric: very good. we will, wayne. good advice. sound advice. coming up, forget protesting. inviting nine union workers to team up with the union bus some here say the new membership drive to drive johns away.

[ male announcer ] usaa auto insurance is often handed down from generation to generation. because it offers a superior level of protection and because usaa's commitment to serve military members, veterans, and their families is without equal. begin your legacy, get an auto insurance quote. usaa. we know what it means to serve.>> eric: coming up, big labor pulling out the rug from workers in america. voter of one state called>> eric: big labor making another big push for members. so far this summer we have seen protest for the nonunion workers and now the afl-cio announcing it will open its doors to any nonunion worker. jonathan, we have been seeing a summer of protest. this is bad for all workers. how so, sir? >> to the extent they join the unions it's bad. unions are pai parasite. they need fresh blood to keep them alive. the union membership is half of what it was on the 1950s. we know what they have done for the companies employed, the hostess or the textile workers long shoremen. they are looking for anyone to sign up. given union membership trends, i think they are likely to be unsuccessful for a good reason. >> eric: john pointed something out. in the last 45 years the union membership consistently with very few exceptions every year, they have lost membemembership. >> go to town. you're all for business decision, this is a business decision for the afl-cio. bring in more members to create more money for themselves. create more action for members. >> they are no longer representing the workers. they represent the political views. at the end of the day they are asking for a lot. giving back very little. i don't hold them as accountable if for government who has not sponsored the jobs in this country. they are not working. they don't have anywhere to go. the policy in the country is not help create jobs. not a business-friendly administration. >> wayne, i guess julie is right. you can't blame them for trying. they will take any workers. what does it mean? any worker nonunionized will pay dues to a union? for what? >> that is the idea. whether or not it's a viable idea is yet to be tested.i don't think anyone will pay a union leader to represent them politically, which is what they are asking. they are not doing anything for the worker. we don't have it anymore. the viability of a union is not what they used to be. there is nothing left for them to do. they are out to perpetuate themselves, they are leaders and trying to get as much money. just like a lobbyist. the lobbyist essentially. >> eric: right. it's a political lobby. unions -- that is their useful, you talk about the useful idiots, that's what they have become. >> unfortunately, not just lobbying, but being granted monopoly power by government. nobody wants to argue against anyone's right to advocate for the principle or position they want. where the unions have gone astray is getting the special favors, granted by the government. we know -- any number of thebusinesses, the industry airlines, automobiles for which the unions have been involved. i can't imagine why. i'm not surprised why most workers are saying no. >> eric: quick thought. >> wall street deserves a lobby, gun owners deserve a lobby but not unions? c'mon. >> whoa, get the lobby, not special favors. >> they represent everything and overall percentage of the workforce -- >> 11% for union membership. diminishing by the day. >> eric: thanks to san dr. dr. and sandra for joining us. lock, loaded, firing back. recalled voters spending a powerful message to the antigun politicians. don't tell us what we can or can't buy with our own money. 20 years with the company. thousands of presentations. and one rd earned partnership. it took a lot of work to get this far.so now i'm supposed to take a back seat when it comes to my investments? there's zero chance of that happening. avo: when you work with a schwab financial consultant, you'll get the guidance you need with the control you want. talk to us today.♪ ♪ >> eric: time for what do i need to know for next week? wayne, you are up first. >> kek out xbi. i'm a little leery of what themarket is doing. long-term, look for the biotech. >> eric: very good. little risky there. go ahead, john. >> africa. this is a hot destination. afk is the exchange traded fund i'm looking at now. this has financials. >> we have to leave it there. i love that song. that is it for cost of freedom block. thank you for joining us. before we go, they call two democratic lawmakers this week. president of the colorado senate, john morris getting booted from the legislature. they are expanding gun control laws. colorado is a blue state. something interested happened in colorado. something the democrats in 2014 might take note of. don't mess with the second a.m. we have a right to bear"

World With Neil Cavuto : FOXNEWS : February 12, 2013 4:00pm-5:00pm EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"let the good times roll. they had a mini carnaval in rome right behind us in rome. it will all be different tomorrow. i'm shepard smith. here comes your world with neil cavuto. >> neil: thank you. tonight barack obama has choice, maggie or nicky or keep playing the same games on spending that have the capital more looking like walt disney. >> all it took a report out out of treasury of a surprising surplus to take the pressure off this president to cut spending this cold night in february. democrats quickly seizing on the data proof the deficits are getting better thanks to higher taxes. the president apparently says that his debt slashing is allbut done, he has come up with $4 trillion budget cuts and mission accomplished. it's over ten years and still leave us $35 trillion more bucks in debt over the same ten years. are we really saying it could have been worse? it could have been $9 trillion more, more or less. don't expect much cutting. because now is not the time to cut. you got to ask yourself, when is the time to cut? if the economy is too fragile to cut spending why is it perfectly fine to raise taxes? so revenue is good and less government bad? it's time to seized moment of spending right now but something tells me not this president and not now because it's clear that barack obama neither senses the urgency to cut spending nor the need and pelosi doesn't even see a spending problem. because now is not the time tobe cutting anything which i think says everything. he'll use the argue coming into office four years ago because we simply couldn't afford to do it then. six trillion in debt and four years later later. seriously, when is the right time to cut? when is the time to get serious. cuts are never easier. just as maggie thatcher, revolt of her own party when she to weather it and end up making history. >> no other party and reckless spending will stay with us. >> remember the boom that followed? the unprecedented boom that followed? for seizing such a moment, maggie thatcher became known as the iron lady. her likely punting big moment, barack obama has little to fearhe will ever be called the ironman. believe me, i hope i am wrong but art laffer i suspect i am not? >> it's the best monologue since johnny carson. >> neil: you are awful. >> are great. >> neil: finish your point. >> i love the spending cut idea. i don't think obama is going to do it but i remember thatcher did it. the reason we have a bad economy in large part is not in spite of it. >> neil: if it wasn't the ideal moment to cut in the midst of a recession four years ago and year later, it was dicey and year after that the recovery was still dicey, when is the right time to cut. maggie thatcher did it the midst of all environments, arguingthat longer term gains would more than justify acute short term pay? >> real serious thing, government spending is taxation, it really is. government doesn't create resources, it redistributes resources. when you should cut unnecessary spending is in the middle of a recession. i know people will tell you it's not true, but it is true. you can't tax an economy out of a recession. you just plain can't. >> neil: and i wanted to get with this into melissa francis into this, whether the first report out of the treasury indicates the whisperings of that. you can't hang your hat on tax hikes and can't be hoping and praying important another internet boom? >> you can't. you have to do a low rate tax and free trade and minimal regulations and get out of theway. the economy will get it out of the sefgs. that is what it is supposed to do. governments aren't the job creators. they set the rules and set the stage and let the private sector handle it. it's unfortunately not what this guy is doing. i hope somewhere along the line we have a boom despite all these bad policies and we probably will, maybe not a boom but we will come out of it. that is despite of the policies but because of them. >> neil: great to see you. >> and it was a magnificent introduction. i loved it. >> neil: let the tax hikes roll in. there is a big reason why the budget numbers are looking good or at least better. crediting higher payroll and income tax revenues for the shocking improvement. payroll taxes, bringing in 9 billion dollars in january andmore taxes and more spending cuts. melissa francis and sandra smith. what do you think? >> i have a totally different interpretation the mainstream media flipped this. you saw it on the screen, this is because the payroll tax cuts expired. they noticed all these writers that their paycheck on january 1st was smaller than it was before. this doesn't have anything to do with the government. that money that disappeared in january, hey, look, there it is. the government has it. i think they are waking up to what is going on. >> neil: i hope you are right, i disagree with you. sandra, one could seize on this and whatever we are doing is working because things are beginning to chug along and deficits are coming down. we're only looking at $800 billion deficit? >> that is not the case. the media is touting that $3 billion surplus, we're on ourway. it has nothing to do with the fact that there were spending less in the month of january. in fact it wasn't because they were growing jobs and economy was actually improving. they were taxing those that were earning more, bottom line, neil it doesn't address how that is going to impact things going forward in the next few months. >> neil: you are going to say it have a growth effect? >> we saw consumer sentiment fall to the lowest level in january as people saw their pay checks shrink. retail sales, it's expected to grow only one-tenth of 1 percent. they shrunk to create the $3 billion surplus but we're not going to be spending and feeling heck a lot worse about the economy. >> neil: what is going around. dow is getting closer to all time record. up 48 points today. they must see the same thing that you report on fox business. either they see it and ignore itor see it? >> they don't care what the government is doing. they are looking a what the fed is doing. that is what the stock market is all about. i don't buy it. i don't think they buy it. g.d.p. contracted in the fourth quarter. that was devastating news a short time ago. they are focused like a laser on ben bernanke and what he is doing. he has said he is targeting unemployment. they don't think it's going to go to 6%. he is going to continue to pump this easy money into the economy and keep interest rates low as long as unemployment doesn't drop too low. it pays to be in stock and bonds. that is what they are reacting to. what wall street is saying, unemployment isn't going down anytime soon. >> neil: what i worry about. we have the data on the left butthe excuse to not do anything. >> let's pace it the stock market has been cheering on bad news. more bad news on the economy, more stock market continues to go higher as melissa is saying, everybody is watching the fed. if things get worse they know they are going to step in and buy back more bonds and boost the stock market. >> neil: what if the president says nothing about spending resolve tonight. what if he continues, more initiatives and more ways to spend. is wall street used to that? >> there is still the threat of sequestration and we all get concerned and we see reality set in the stock market. everybody is starting to feel ancy how stocks and how high they are. >> neil: automatic spending cuts take place on march 1st, a lot of people think better than that tax hikes, we may go with that. >> actual real spending cuts in there, it's not when thepresident talks about $1.7 trillion he is going to save, it has to do with budget caps that may or may not happen, spending caps that no one believes is going to happen. its reduction in interest payments when they say -- interest payments will be smaller. >> neil: but mission all but accomplished on this? >> he leaves the uncertainty on the table. markets don't like uncertainty. if bare still left with that doubt going up to march 1st, we will see it reflected in the stock market. >> i think everybody is focused on the short term and they see what is right in front of them. easy money. they see companies are okay and they think unemployment is going to stay high and everybody is focused what is in front of them. nobody cares about the cbo reported showing what is going to happen to the economy if we continue to have the huge debt. they don't care.>> neil: ladies, thank you very much. in the meantime, i wanted you to alert coverage on fox business coverage, it starts at 8:00 p.m. we have powerful names there. you can see them but they are going to be going over what the impact of the president's speech and added

[ male announcer ] at his current pace,bob will retire when he's 153, which would be fine if bob were a vampire. but he's not. ♪ he's an architect with two kids and a mortgage. luckily, he found someone who gave him a fresh perspective on hisortfolio. and with some planning and effort, hopefully bob can retire at a more appropriate age. it's not rocket science. it's just common sense. from td ameritrade.>>. >> neil: all right, we are getting word of a fire-fight in los angeles involving that fugitive ex-cop christopher dorner. you might recall he is wanted for the murder of a police officer michael crane and attempted murder of three otherofficers. what is going on in los angeles right now he is trapped and exchanging fire with california police authorities. we don't know much more than that. there is, indeed, a national manhunt for this guy. he has brought are vendetta who have crossed him, but they seem to have found dorner but we don't know for sure whether they've got dorner or can confirm that it is dorner. we do know there aggressive exchange of gunfire in los angeles. we don't know much more than that. when we do have more, we will, of course, keep you posted. >> other developments, in the meantime, just take a look what is going on with the repeat of history. i am sure you remember the ripping this president took for this. how about this president for this. president obama making the casethat his debt mission is accomplished. take a look at this and virginia governor, he is not sure this is won by anybody. if he is saying that he is close to spending cuts over ten years, is that bad? >> we don't know. i think you and your former guests larry hit a good point. yours was an excellent point. what is wrong with someone going on to make that -- you just heard that. this is what i think about that. one of the beautiful things about the person that is going to give the rebuttal, there is no rebuttal to the rebuttal. he can say anything he wants to his interpretation of speech. the real deal is this. the president has been the master of the bully-pulpit.nobody argues that. he has been able to get things out and public has heard it. the republicans have not managed a mess edger to make a unified response. will it happe tonight? i don't know. >> neil: we do have to break away for developments in california. very quickly, i do want to get your thoughts on what is going on within the democratic party if the president is saying and nancy pelosi is saying, this whole debt cutting thing, we're done, that is not a focus anymore where moderates are saying not so fast? >> just saying accomplishes anything. you are absolutely right. if you look at the simpson-boles package that was supposed to be approached and yet people walk away from that. i'm very pleased we have found this person and i hope they gotthe right person zbhn as do we. governor, it's a pleasure. i apologize again. law enforcement officials say they believe that they have that fugitive dorner in their sights. a firefight. trace gallagher is in los angeles right now with the very latest. what can you tell us. >> trace: this is very fluid. we can tell you big bear on highway 38 one of roads, main roads that goes off from big bear which we have seen several times going down towards southern california toward riverside. there are reports now, a couple different reports either a home invasion with a suspect that the ""l.a. times"" is in fact christopher dorner tied a woman up or a couple up and then stole their white ford truck or their white dodge truck and fled. then there were reports that fish and game authorities actually spotted that truck and that gunfire was exchanged. it's very unclear at this pointin time if anybody was hit in that exchange. we're listening to scanner traffic. the scanner traffic is somewhat confusing so we don't want to go there just yet. we do know they were chasing a suspect on foot. there were reports they might have had somebody in custody and they are backing off those reports. in the past 15-20 minutes we have been hearing this ongoing traffic about now authorities kind of converging on this one area on big bear mountain. those don't know the back story, for the past five days, thoughts have been just flooding that mountain trying to find christopher dorner who shot a young couple then shot three police officers killing one of them. they believe now says the ""l.a. times"" that they do have christopher dorner either on the run or he is blocked out or in some cases they are reporting he is already in custody. we're trying to find out through various sources. there is no confirmation fromany police authority. we are in contact with lapd and san bernardino's sheriff's office but there is christian dorner is cornered or at least has been spotted in the past 10-15 minutes. >> neil: the couple you talked about, tied up at a cabin and one was able to break away and make the call, do you know that? >> this is a couple. christopher dormer who put out a manifesto and the young couple, the woman was the daughter of the lawyer who actually defended christopher dorner a at this police board hearing that ultimately led him getting fired. her fiance was the other person that was murdered in your vine which is 30 miles away where the police officers actually shot about three days later. then when this manifesto went public, police started con vergego because he named names. they started going out protecting all of these, quote, targets. that is when christopher dorner came one of those target, lapd pulled him over and opened fire on them. he then fled and 15 minutes later, that is when he shot and killed a riverside police officer, shot and wounded another police officer and then fled. now, we also know that subsequent to that he was seen in san diego trying to steal a boat. he couldn't steal it because the rope got caught around the propeller. he went to the boat saying he was going towards mexico and someone that found his wallet at the crossing between tijuana and san diego. then about nine hours later, when his truck was spotted in big bear, it was spotted at the home of one of the people who was named in his manifesto. that is the last time that christopher dorner or anythingabout him was spotted until about 15 minutes ago. now, we're hearing that in fact, they've got, is in fact a shooting going on. we have our fox affiliate in los angeles en route with their helicopter. they should be arriving at any moment. we're going to try to switch over so we can get it on television because our window is up and bear with us. >> neil: absolutely. >> hold on for a second. >> we're talking to christopher dorner or the person that is believed to be the fugitive exchanging gunfire with authorities. law enforcement was speaking on this on condition of anonymity but another one reported that looking like christopher dorner. that doesn't mean it's necessarily christopher dorner, but they have very likelihood that it is. of course, this has been anearly week long what began and now a state and national manhunt for this former ex-cop who has a lot of weapons at his disposal. a lot of expertise and a lot of anger. trace gallagher back on from los angeles. this was almost unprecedented manhunt for this guy. they were following any and all leads. apparently it paid off today. >> trace: the big event in california history. they flooded big bear mountain with hundreds of officers and the genesis was this manifesto where he was naming 40 different police officers in or connected to the los angeles police department. so they had all these police officers being protected and then you have this massive force up on big bear which is maybe 120 miles east-northeast oflos angeles. they flooded with s.w.a.t. teams and officers and investigators and despite the fact that christopher dorner's truck was found burned out with weapons inside and footprints leading away from there they couldn't find him. couple on tha on shortly after he disappeared it begin snowing up there. you had s.w.a.t. teams and the entire air brigade had to be grounded. then you had the officers o searching on foot what amounted to be blizzard where they got 12 inches of snow up there. so any tracks were clearly covered up there. were out cabins, summer cabins that were in the back country at big bear. they tried to check as many as possible. some of them had been abandoned and vacant for years, quite frankly, there are hundreds of these summer cabins up there. it would be difficult to check all of them and go back and double check again. this area we're talking abouttoday, there are two main roads that go in and out of big bear. this is highway 38. it's one of the main roads that goes out of big bear. the reports we're getting is that apparently that christopher dorner who apparently got tired of waiting says the ""l.a. times"" and either carjacked or home invaded a couple and tied them up and stole their white dodge pickup. that is when fish and game authorities came in contact with him at that point in time and shootout begin. keep in mind as this situation goes on, we are getting reports that this is an ongoing shooting. you have fish and game, i'm quoting here, san bernardino police department sending a 12 man tactical team to the scene. there were two assault weapons, two assault rifles that were inside that car. it is believed he had handguns as well as assault rifles. it may be that we're dealingwith a suspect who is armed with only handguns or he may have other weapons at his disposal. we know throughout this ordeal he was heavily armed. he said in his manifesto he knows the tactics of the l.a. police department and he will use those tactics to gain his freedom and to gain revenge against them saying he wanted to create an asymmetrical war and would come at them with a different angle. today he got tired of hiding out and decided to make a break for it. that is when authorities came in contact with him. we are getting one of reporters is saying that again there is ongoing fight here. the police scan ser calling for reserves to come in. they are calling for an all hands on deck situation, neil, in this this enclave of the mountains of southern cal. they believe that they havetheir man cornered or now involved in a firefight with christopher dorner who has been on the run for better part of nine days. >> neil: you mentioned asymmetrical war he claimed in his manifesto that involved 40-50 names. very angry. allegedly killed several folks. he didn't strike me as a person in the middle of this fire fight will go quietly into the night zbloolgt no, this is guy who said, i don't --. >> trace: no, this is a guy that said he would not see his name cleared. he feels he was wronged by the l.a. police department. he feels he was wrongly fired because he turned in a police officer for what he said was excessive force against someone that was being arrested. they had a hearing and they deemed he was lying. then he was fired.he said he would not live to see his name cleared, but that he said, i'm quoting again here, that he would in fact seek revenge against the sheriffs or police officials who took away his life and his good name. saying he never had a chance to have a family and now he was going to take their family and first two victims, say police, the soften and the daughter rather and fiance of the man who defended christopher dorner during that hearing that ultimately led to him being fired. >> neil: trace, separate issue, they check the border thinking he may have fled there. obviously did not seem to be the case here. with reports now that some officers down, do we know for example if he is by himself or any hostages or anything like that? >> the reports we have heard so far, he is in fact by himself.he stole this white dodge truck and he is by himself and heavily armed. the reports you are referring to about him fleeing to mexico that all transpired because there was a u.s. marble's report that he left his -- marshals report that he left his badge and wallet near the border. the boat he attempted to steal, he told the man a he could pick up in mexico. where his truck was found in big bear was a known associate of his. his parents own a home in big bear and the truck was found as the police were surveiling that home. it all ties together. they believe at some point, maybe he has an accomplice. when you fled with every resource and you still can't find this guy, plan ""b"", he hadsome type of associate or accomplice to get him off the mountain. now, we know if these reports are true, that somehow he was able to evade police for these past several days. in our he has decided that he was going to make a run for it at first. if they have him cornered now he is willing to fight it out. we believe he is armed to do so. as to reports where you say there are officers down, we had heard a couple scanner reports. we hated to go with this. it's very fluid. we heard couple scanner reports of police officers down, not one but two times. we are tempering this with the fact that none of this has been confirmed. that is why we're going plodding along. we're awaiting, they are still flying to the scene. it should take them 10-12minutes to actually get to the mountain so they can get a better idea what is going on. in a situation like this, you may have police waving off the helicopters so they don't give too much away. >> neil: i want to bring people up to speed. the biggest manhunt in california history, it seems to be coming to a fiery conclusion and potentially deadly one. christopher dorner is in in a gun battle with authorities. the outcome is unknown. we have a couple officers were down. we don't know the severity of their injuries. we do know that th shooting occurred after he burglarized a home in the area, tied up a couple stole their car. we're not immediately clear of the status of the couple or for that matter whether dorner was and is acting on his own, hadsome help, but he is in fire fight. others have identified this scene as an active crime scene. and trace revealed law enforcement officials are swarming the area given the fact that this guy knows authorities their secrets and going after bad guys. he is up on their strategy and he is apparently loaded. we don't know how much weaponry we has but detective, former washington homicide detective joins us right now. detective, what is the best strategy in dealing with this guy right now? >> i can tell you exactly what the police are doing. they are setting up a perimeter. that is always what we do any time we confront a suspect in the manner they have confronted this guy. even if he is shooting at police. police will not return fire atthis point. we're going to allow him to continue to fire if that is what he is doing until we get the experts. they do have the e.r. t.unit en route. these guys are specially trained. once they get into position, then they are going to return fire. as long as we know we got this guy cornered, as long as the police have him cornered. that is where they are going to keep him at bay right now. we don't know how much weaponry he has, but at this point it doesn't matter. the main focus for the police is to keep this guy cornered, make sure there is no other individuals in the area that can be harmed and then at some point the response is going to be dramatic from the police department. >> neil: this is obviously a wooded area. when you talk about whether there are people in the immediate area, they don't knowwhether he has anyone with him? >> that is one of the biggest challenges. i can tell you they are evacuating that entire, immediate area. we don't know if he has anybody hostage right now. we have to be careful. that is why the police will probably not return fire right now. the goal of the police is to keep themselves safe, keep this guy cordoned off and like i said when swat arrives and they will go in full steam ahead. >> is it your feeling given the prior violence and obviously the manhunt that has ensued for the better part of a week, this is guy who is not just going to quietly surrender? >> no, he is not going to quietly surrender. that is evident. i can tell you the police they know that. i have spoken to sources and they are all heavily armed because we anticipated this guy wanted to go out in a blaze.if you notice that is why the police have never left the big bear area. we thought in the back of our minds he was somewhere in that area and it likes look he is still there. >> neil: they didn't given up in the big bear area. and he may have crossed the border down into mexico, they never took that seriously either did they? >> no, they didn't. as a matter of fact they did look at that, they've been in conversation with the department of homeland security, but never moved a major artillery away from the big bear mountain. >> we are back to the geography of this area. it presents its own set of problems? >> it does because you have a couple roads going in and out. they have blocked off that highway so there is nobody coming in or going. we have gotten word we're talking about deputies that have reportedly been shot.there is now scanner traffic saying they want someone come in and get the wounded. we're now getting reports that there are possible wounded police officers and sheriff's deputies on the scene. remember, in the early going, we heard the shootout was between fish and game and christopher dorner. now, we have in fact police have confirmed to us that they do believe this activity does involve christopher dorner. again, we've got kttv, you can get a look and what they don't want is dorner to go back up in the mountains. the big fear he would try to lure them into some type of trap. they thought he had weapons. he said he wanted to kill numerous police officers. what they didn't want to do especially during the snowstorm was to try and send their authorities and officials into the jaws of evil and beambushed. two police officers that he shot in riverside, those police officers were ambushed. they were sitting, stopped at a red light and walked up to them and unloaded and shot both of them killing one. he is not adverse to ambushing police officers and he wanted to go out in a hail of gunfire. he is getting his wish right now. there are reports the fire fight is continuing. they are bringing more tactical units in from the los angeles county sheriff's department as well as the riverside county sheriff's department as well as local police on the scene that have been there for the better part of six days trying to find christopher dorner. they do believe this is the real deal. nobody is saying they don't believe this is dorner anymore, they think this is the guy. now it's a matter how it ends. does it end with dorner going in a hail of bullets. they believe he has struck a couple of sheriff's deputies. again we want to stress that isunconfirmed, but they are calling for ambulances. they are calling for back-up and christopher dorner is still armed, unclear if he is barricaded, unclear if she backing up this entire shootout. as we get more information and as kttv gets closer, we'll get a better idea what is happening. right now they are just at the edge of mountains. they are not quite to big bear. they are crawling over, they are five minutes we're told from the chopper pilot. crawling over the mountains as you go into the local san bernardino mountains and you get toward big bear lake and we'll have a much better picture of police activity and what is going on. right now, the report and scanner traffic telling us this shootout is under way. that it does involve the man they have been looking now for nine days, christopher dorner,who shot and killed a young couple, shot and wounded two police officers, shot and killed another police officer. this shootout is on. >> neil: we're also getting word that all schools, hospitals and public buildings in and around the area. from five to seven miles are in lockdown. this immediate area that dorner is supposedly holed up in is a collection of rental homes. again, the big bear area. and to trace's point they have already recovered a rifle, possibly a can of gas. the car that he had belonged to the people who he had held hostage earlier. he is without a vehicle of any sort and we don't know how much weaponry we he has with him and obviously enough to keep policeat bay? >> i understand the shooting has been going on. we don't know how many bullets he has actually fired and how many bullets authorities ever fired. how much weaponry does he have. we know he was carrying handguns. we know we left two assault rifles inside that burned out car. we also left camping gear inside the car. so the question was, if you are looking to survive in the mountains and looking for a shootout, why are would you leave two weapons in the car as well as your cold weather gear. that was unclear. we still don't have the answer. we may at some point in time. we do know he has apparently procured another weapon and he could be there for a while because we know he had another assault weapon we believe as well as handguns. so what he used to fire at these law enforcement authorities is unclear. the fact that he is firing at these law enforcement authorities is very clear. right now, we have a situation in big bear.to give people reference as kttv is going up over the mountain to find out where it is. police presence and correspondents on the ground is massive. it's getting bigger and bigger. they are not about, if they can help it, make his way back up in the mountains and saturday the search all over again especially when you have more police officers who potentially have been wounded in this shootout. they want this to end. they want it to end now. >> neil: stay there if you can. chris dorner is surrounded. it's going to be hard for him to get away. pretty much, it's going to be his call from here on out. he has taken a couple officers down. severity of those injuries has trace has reported, we're going to try to get the latest from william at lapd headquarters. what can you tell us. >> reporter: we know that fishand game has said that four to six of their wardens saw this white truck going down highway 38 from big bear, halfway between big bear lake and redlands, california. the wardens attempted to stop him in the white dodge truck. they had exchange of gunfire with california fish and game. no one was hurt in that initial volley of gunfire, however then, dorner bailed out of the vehicle. they got into a foot race. he headed into the woods. one of the local reporters was literally on the scene and over the air you could hear hundreds of shots being fired. the officers were telling him to get down in his car. a lot of profanity being used at the time. he was in the middle of it. you could hear a lot of gunfire between the officers anddetectives and sheriff's deputies and wardens and christopher dorner who had plenty of ammunition. two officers, deputies we're not sure exactly what agency they are affiliated with have been injured. we know at least one of them has been airlifted to a hospital. i might want to backtrack but we now know dorner basically broke into one of cabins and took the truck. what we're not sure exactly when that happened. whether or not it happened dating back to basically last thursday or friday or how long was he in the woods before he broke into this cabin. we know the search has been going on for a long time. we know a lot of officers said he didn't believe he was there any longer. they scaled the search 120 to 20 to 30 officers going through remote cabins. i'm assuming they knocked on a door and i'm told in this areathere are hundreds of cabins. maybe they hadn't come down this far on the mountain. i heard reports it was 10-15 miles from where his burned out truck was found. i'm talking about roughly this area around highway 38. it sounds like they do have christopher dorner on the run, in the woods somewhere around san bernardino national forest. >> neil: keep in mind, he is crazy or whatever you want to call him. he is apparently very crafty and avoided a pursuit in the past and gotten away a number of times before. we have heard that smoke degree naits niadz have been thrown in time to literally smoke him up. trace gallagher, do you know anything about that. >> trace: actually christopher dorner had smoke grenades, i can see our affiliate and going intothe cabins. the reason they are doing that, now we are getting reports that christopher dorner might have kind of withdrawn from this firefight and may be holed up in one of these cabins. really, if you look at this topography, he knows this area probably better than the police officers because he has been up there for the past five days kind of making his way around these mountains. they have surrounded now one cabin. we have gotten word of and now we are told they are setting up perimeters and bringing nor law enforcement officers in to figure out exactly when which one of these cabins he may be holed up this. for the time being and reports coming in from locals who are on the scene, for the time being, it appears the firefight has ended and back on the search for christopher dorner. we do know that two police officers as william was saying,unclear if they are sheriff's deputies or police officers have been injured in some capacity. we believe they were hit with bullets. we do not know the severity of their wounds. we do know they are being taken to hospitals or at least one has been airlifted to a hospital. that is really the clearest picture we've gotten so far. this is kind of really small sample of the barricade. you have s.w.a.t. teams and law enforcement officers on the other side which would give you an indication wherever the fire fight was, it's not too far off the road. snow is about 14-16 inches. they had a little bit before so this is happening within the deep snow. you have officers and this may be what they are kind of surrounded. one of cabins that line up along the road as you go down. at least according to scanner traffic, it's unclear as to which one he might be in. the shooting has stopped. the police officers have set upa perimeter. they are calling for more tactical units and calling for more police power on the scene. now, they are trying to figure out exactly which one of these out buildings or cabins he might be inside because he is heavily armed and if they can find out where she, they would waited him out as long as he doesn't decide to come out and started firing again. >> neil: thank you very much. you've got new developments from the lapd, what can you tell us? >> you know, the mayor antonio villaraigosa it's not just a question of if and when and the noose is tightening. we know from the manifesto he never intend to be taken alive. people thought he had a gunshot to the head and was dead. never, what i was going to say, it's a real problem for the taskforce. as long as dorner was alive he could not take down his guard. he could not remove that protective shield around the lapd officers and family that this guy had h threatened. nor could they pull their people out of big bear just in case he surfaced. think of the political fallout of that. then, of course, you had the wider issue of just did he didn't show up for days or weeks. as expensive as it was, to keep one 24-hour shift staffed, that is equivalent of five full time polgsz. he was dedicated can thousand officers to chase this guy and man the task force phones what has amounted to thousand tips coming into the task force since the reward was posted of million dollars. it's now at $1.2 million but nevertheless has trace ismonitoring the affiliates, it sounds like like they have him surrounded and getting ready to make sure they have all the manpower and firepower to go in on him so no one else is injured. >> neil: that statewide national manhunt made his picture so recognizable photo in america. almost anywhere he woulding in that area, he would be instantly recognizable? >> that was definitely the kind of double-edged sword here because he was so well known, he couldn't show up at a gas station without being recognized. as you have seen from surveillance video, it's everywhere now whether you check into a motel or get gasoline, someone has your photo and just a question of finding you. also today, just to reiterate, police were on track. they said to residents in big bear just this morning, pleasing over your surveillance video,your home surveillance video to see if you see this guy, maybe in a vehicle any time between last thursday and today. so as of earlier today, they didn't have any idea where he was and he turns upright under their nose right in the area they have been searching all along. >> neil: thank you very much. it's hard to believe this whole saga with six foot, 270 pound former policeman begin six days ago after authorities say, chris dorner took out captain's daughter and her fiance and released a manifesto that he first posted on fb. here is where it got interest ago for state officials, very intimidating and worrying that he was declaring a warfare on all of those individuals which left the state police to do something unprecedented. assign officers to guard the more 50 families connect"

more government spending. he vowed his plans would be fully paid for. >> nothing i am proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. it is not a bigger government we need but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad based growth. >> peter doocy is live in washington with more on last night's address. good morning, peter. >> president obama told the nation last night that reducing the deficit should be part of the federal government's agenda. the north star that guides her effort must be a growing economy that creates good middle class joabs. he also says nobody works full-time should have to live in poverty and proposed raising the minimum wage about 25 percent from 7.25 to $9 an hour. >> since the last time this congress raised the minimum wage19 states have chosen to bump theirs even hire. tonight let's declare in the healthiest nation on earth no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. we should be able to get that done. >> the president mentioned mitt romney twice in his address once he and the former republican nominee for president agreed raising the minimum wage for the cost of living was a good idea. bipartisan compromise has been hard to come by since november 11th. if both sides don't try try to they want he will do it with a pen a series of executive orders. if congress won't act soon to protect future generations iwill. i will direct my cabinets to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.   the president will lead to try to help the middle class there. they will do the same thing in georgia and illinois. peter doocy live in washington, thank you. that brings us to our look who is talking. we are hearing from florida senator marco rubio. last night following the president's state of the union it was rubio chosen to give the public response and play out the differences between the two parties. >> my parents immigrated here in pursuit of the opportunity to improve their life and a chance for their children to have a better one. they made it to the middle class. my dad working agz a bartendermy mother as a cashier and a made. i didn't inherit any money from them. i inherited something far better the real opportunity to accomplish my dream. raising taxes won't make a better job. that's why i hope the president will abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy. this idea that our problems were caused by a government that was too small is just not true. in fact a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created reckless government policies and the idea that more taxes and more government spending is a way to help middle class taxpayers that's an old idea failed every

gretawire for you. go read it, answer it. we'll see you tomorrow night, good night. . >> bill: the o'reilly factor is on. tonight: >> [shouting] >> bill: two christian activists attacked at a gay rally in seattle. the situation gets out of hand. why does this kind of thing continue to happen? we'll have a special report. >> very difficult bill to pass because there is a lot of moving parts. and for legislative process can be ugly. >> strike over immigration reform also very apparent within the republican party. how will the g.o.p. solve this huge problem? we will tell you. >> the law as written probably can't work. >> i think the whole thing may collapse. >> bill: brit hume says obama care may be dead on arrival. mr. hume will be here.caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. the factor begins right now. ♪ ♪ >> bill: hi, i'm bill o'reilly. thanks for watching us tonight. the era of bad feelings. that is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. all over the country, americans are attacking other americans over political issues. on sunday, june 30th in seattle, two christian activists showed up at a gay pride rally holding signs saying repent or else and jesus saves from sin. the two men were attacked. >> that's a big [bleep] if i were you i would [bleep] [shouting] >>[screaming] seattle police have arrested two men, the fat guy who was slugging him and i think that's the guy, well, i shouldn't say, this one of the men arrested has nine felonies, nine on his rap sheet. now, obviously this is very disturbing, yes, the christians were looking to be provocative, but, that's no excuse for violence. if gays really want to be proud, they will overlook criticism like that. on another political issue, tensions are also rising. immigration reform has divided mucks. in favor, marco rubio, john mccain orrin hatch, general and george w. bush against rand paul, mitch mcconnell, ted cruz, limbaugh and sarah palin. >> i think it's important to fix a broken system. treat people with respect.have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people. it's a very difficult bill to pass because there is a lot of moving parts. and, the legislative process is -- can be ugly. and but it looks like they are making some progress. >> now, talking points believes that immigration reform will pass this year. i also think the senate bill can be made much better by the house of representatives. loopholes need to be closed and border security should be paramount in the new law. but if you're gonna oppose any kind of work legalization for millions of illegal aliens. you're going to lose. majority of americans understand that the immigration chaos is partially the government's fault. we could have secured the southern border a long time ago, but the feds wouldn't do it. and we certainly can pro-prosecute people who oversay their visas. again, the justice department doesn't care. the bitterness over immigration does the republican party no good at all. fair minded americans do not want unfair policies.so, immigration must be dealt with in a disciplined, but humane manner. now, as far as the far left loons you saw running wild in seattle. there is little hope for them. beating people up because you disagree with them is a crime. the far left in america continues to damage this country. and that's the memo. now, for the top story tonight, more chaos on the obama care front as you may know. the president has put often forcing obama care mandates for american business until 2015. and late friday deep into the fourth of july holiday, the obama administration announces it will not verify the incomes of individuals asking for obama care subsidies. that, of course, is madness and would lead to massive fraud. today, the feds backed out a little bit and they said well, maybe some kind of verification might happen, but you can see how screwed up this whole thing is. joining us now from washington a man who sees big trouble ahead for obamacare, fox news senior political analyst brit hume. what's the biggest problem so far with this? >> you just touched on it, it's the seeming inability of the administration to get this thing imflemented. let's not forget that lost month the government accountability office looked at the exchanges, which is one of the principle vehicles through which insurance will be dispensed under obama care and they're supposed to be, you know, one in every state either set up by the state or the federal government. the gao says -- looked to it as if they might not be ready on time. they are supposed to be ready in october for people to start signing up. if they are not ready and the employer mandate isn't in effect, that leaves obama care in a well-behind-schedule for its implementation for as much as a year or more. it looks as if this thing is so unwieldy they can't get it going. biggest thing they face right now. long standing popularity. >> bill: i have always believed that this is -- the obama care legislation is an income redistributionploy. that's why it was supported by the left and president obama embraced it so much that 20 million americans or 30 million -- i forget what the number is -- who don't have insurance, many of those people just don't have any money. so you are basically giving them free insurance that brit hume, bill o'reilly and everybody else is paying through their tax receipts. giving them free insurance. but now comes word i love. this they sneak it out like we're not going to get it on monday? do they think we are not going to see this we can't really verify obama care. so that anybody who applies for this subsidy, the free insurance can pretty much get it even if they are making $800,000 a year. and i'm going to myself: this is insane. am i wrong? >> well, no. you are not wrong. and, you know, i think they were always going to have to rely to some extent on the say so of the applicants.remember, too, bill, one of the problems they are having is now that they have postponed the employer mandate, the easiest way for them to know which employers are providing insurance and which are not is gone, at least for a full year after this program is supposed to start. that means that when people apply for and obama care subsidy, onef the requirements is that you not be getting insurance already through your employer. well, the easiest way to verify that is now gone. so, in addition to the problems they may have verifying income eligibility, they also have problems verifying the question of whether the employer is providing insurance or not, so that's another problem. >> bill: if you strip it away, anybody who applies for subsidies, nobody is getting obama care under their employers until 2015. that comes off the table. >> no. no the employers are not required. a lot of people -- look, you and i have it through the company we work for. we will continue to have it. >> bill: we have insurance coverage. >> brit: that's what theemployers are required to furnish to at least businesses with 50 or more employees. >> bill: that will be it. but the ones that are not involved, okay, they are off the table now for years. so you can walk in and basically say, hey, i don't really have any insurance. can you give it to me because i don't have any money. and if nobody is going to verify your income, you could have, as i said, a lot of money and who is going to know? the irs might get involved. i guess they are going to stop auditing the conservatives and take a look at this. recommendation eventually they would be able to find out through the tax returns and the tax system and they would have to go back after this. look, let's not forget another problem here. this employer mandate applies to companies with 50 or more employees. that means that a lot of companies are going to make sure that they don't have 50 full time employees. >> bill: that's hurting the employment. >> it's going it hurt hiring, bound to. because that's a perverse incentive for hiring. and similarly going it hurt people looking forfull-time work and finding because of obama care they can only get part-time work. this will tend to be a drag on hiring which is the last thing a nation with 7.5% or more people -- >> bill: that's why he they're put it off to 2015. hire people and that's why they did it? >> i suppose. i think also the thing with -- i think legitimately they couldn't get it going. it raises the question whether they will ever be able to. this law is extremely unwieldy and complex, bill. they are having a terrible time with it. >> bill: that's for sure. brit hume, everybody. next on the run down the judge in the zimmerman murder trial says the jury can hear

finally the judge has ruled that the jury can hear about traces of marijuana being in trayvon martin's system at the time of his death. joining us now from washington, fox news contributors mary katharine ham and juan williams. so, juan, is the case all about race and, if so, are you seeing bad things if zimmerman is acquitted? >> yeah, of course it's all about race. it's been all about race from the start. remember when the media, i think, unfirly libeled zimmerman making him out to be some, you know, kkk guy who has profiled trachmartin right from the start. described him to police played with the tape to make that happen. and i think right now it's sad to me because i think the media now is playing for the most primitive racial division. conservative posted to back zimmerman. liberals are supposed to back trayvon martin. i think it's become like for them you know o.j. simpson rodney king redo. and the second part of your question already you see that in sanford, florida religious leaders, civic leaders are now having to go out and hold meetings with the community trying it say don't have a riot if somehow, you know, zimmerman is acquitted of this crime. >> bill: what do you think mary katharine? do you think bad things are going to happen if zimmerman is acquitted. >> i pray that they don't. i am glad there is civic leaders involved and on this issue. i do think that when you have the entire media really jump to make this a racial more rattle play from the very beginning. >> bill: how is the media doing that?juan cited a couple of bogus things that came out of nbc news doctored tapes that made zimmerman look like a racist in the very beginning of the case. >> right. >> bill: we exposed this here. how does the media continue to make this all about race and not justice? >> i think from the very beginning, when they referred to it as a very simple frankly white and black issue, when that was not the case for zimmerman certainly, he was raised in a multiracial household. so a lot more complicated than what they first presented. i think once they went in hard on that narrative, they sort of had to back it up as we went along and media reports referring to zimmerman as a white hispanic, whatever that means. so, the problem is when you make something into a national conversation about race in this country, it's pretty likely you are actually not going to be having much of a conversation because it becomes on its face racist to examine the facts and bring up the fact of zimmerman's upbringing or what have you. then you get to the situation where we have a reasonable doubt system.and it is not necessarily going to come down in exactly the way that the media decided and everyone decided it should from the very beginning. >> bill: what happens, mary katharine if the man is acquitted. the reportage last week across the board, not only on the fox news channel but on the other news agencies as well said the prosecution presented a weak case. i didn't hear anybody say the prosecution presented a strock case, i didn't hear anybody. and today you get the 911 thing just devastated, just thrown out because the mother, trayvon martin's mother was an effective witness last week and now today it's all gone because the number of people said oh, no, no, no, it was zimmerman's voice and the father and all of this. so, if the prosecution did present a weak case and that again, is the consensus of the media following it, even the liberal media. >> yes. >> and he does get acquitted mary katharine, are you expecting people to run out and cause trouble? >> i think some people will react emotionally. i think it's been emotionally charged from the beginning and part of that is the way it wasportrayed by the media from the very beginning. part of it is also a general wish grievance. >> bill: possibility for damage to be done to the fabric of the nation. if this verdict comes in as an acquittal. if it comes in as guilty, i don't think there is going to be any violence. think think there will be people that will be angry. >> let me say the damage done to the fabric of the country by the way the media has portrayed it and the way it's been handled. you know, look, if my kid walks up to your house, bill o'reilly and some guy says oh, i saw a black kid walking up to bill o'reilly's house so i shot him, you would be like what is going on here? if a black guy shot a white kid, and they said oh, the kid was carrying skittles and ice tea you know what these punks get away with it all the time. forget who was on top of who and who was punching who. why was a guy with a gun deciding he had to it act violently with a teen with an ice tea. >> bill: you have to buyinto the six women sitting there are going to do the right thing based upon the evidence and their convictions of what -- >> -- you have to pray. it's an all white -- i think it's five whites and one hispanic on that jury. it's kind of odd to me. but so be it. you have to hope. it just seems to me there is something crazy here when this black kid unarmed not hurting anybody gets shot and killed. >> bill: you are almost fueling the potential violence here by saying that. >> i'm not. >> bill: you are. let the facts be presented and the jurors decide, go ahead, mary katharine. >> i was going to say i do think part of the emotion comes from the fact that there are genuine grievances with the black community with the justice system. black men are arrested for main use far higher rates than white people even though the usage rates are the same. there is some of that comes from that i don't think this is the way to actually address those by turning this into a situation that becomes tainted by race at every turn. both of you feel that there is a strong violence ifacquittal comes down. we have to now the media try to tamp that down starlight now. next on the run down, actor lamar burton says race is a major factor in the u.s.a. and in the lives of for instance and not in a good way. later, bernie goldberg and adam carolla will both opine on the factor. opine on the factor. we're coming right back. oh, he's a fighter alright. since aflac is helping with his expenses while he can't work, he can focus on his recovery.he doesn't have to worry so much about his mortgage, groceries, or even gas bills. kick! kick... feel it! feel it! feel it! nice work! ♪ you got it! you got it! yes! aflac's gonna help take care of his expenses. and us...we're gonna get him back in fighting shape. ♪ [ le announcer ] see what's happening behind the scenes at aflac.com.>> bill: personal story segment tonight, as for instance see the trayvon martin george zimmerman situation and life in general. joining us from los angeles actor lamar burton. are you following the trial closely mr. burton. >> i'm following it not closely. i don't watch the trial daily. i get a daily update through my twitter feed andother news sources. >> any preconceived opinions on it? >> on the outcome of the trial? >> yeah. on the situation? i mean, you just heard. >> the process. >> you just heard juan say that it disturbs him that the whole thing was in motion thatten a unarmed black man who just out for a soda and candy winds up dead. >> um-huh. >> those are the kind of perceptions that can cause angst if a verdict comes in that is an acquittal. you know that. >> that's part of the tragedy of this case that a young man unfessly lost his life. no matter, you know, what the verdict says, there is a young kid who is dead. and did it really need to come to that. >> bill: it didn't. it didn't need to come to. but now we have to see that the person who shot -- >> -- we have to see if the system works. >> bill: it's more profound than thanks we he have to see if the system works. >> bill: it's more profound than that. is the man guilty of murder because that's what he is charged with. >> yeah.>> bill: if is he acquitted, you as an friend and an intelligent guy, if zimmerman verdict comes out not guilty by the jury, do you know what your reaction is going to be? >> i don't. no. i didn't know what my reaction to the oj zherdev verdict was going to be. there have -- there have been many, many when i have been surprised. >> bill: what is borrow yoction when he was acquitted? >> i was really surprised. i did not see that coming. >> bill: did you think justice was done in the case? >> i have no idea of knowing. >> so you were neutral on that and you were just surprised that he got -- >> -- it was a very -- it was a very -- it was a very shocking moment. i mean, i think no matter what your expectations were, the idea that you had seen the progression from the slow speed chase through all of the courtroom drama and to havebeen up against those odds to say not guilty was a big surprise. >> bill: yeah, and the evidence was overwhelming against simpson and the civil trial pointed that out. so, it was interesting. so, you, right now, don't know if zimmerman is found not guilty and that doesn't mean he is innocent. not guilty means that the state has not met its burden in proving that there was murder. again, this is the sophisticated thing that i think is being lost on a lot of people. all right. you made some provocative comments on a news network about driving while being black. driving while being black. and you said -- >> -- why was what i said provocative? >> white people understand. i don't understand. i was pulled over by a black cop a few weeks ago. he obviously didn't like me and gave me a nice big ticket even though i had a pretty good excuse for what i was doing. that was all right. i was wrong. i took the ticket.i didn't feel threatened in any way. i picked up the vibe that he is not a big factor fan. but you, on the other hand, when you are pulled over, you feel -- >> -- the difference between you and me, bill, is that and i may well get to a very pleasant exchange with an officer once he approaches the car. the difference between when you get stopped and when i get stopped is i want to make sure that that time between when the officer leaves his car and approaches mine that he is as relaxed as possible. >> bill: that the officer is as relaxed as possible? >> that the is officer is as relaxed as possible. >> bill: why do you want to make sure he was relaxed? because that didn't pop into my brand. what popped into my brain i will explain why i did this and he will understand. it wasn't that i want him to be relaxed. why do you want him to be relaxed? >> because, because i live in a country and in a culture where it can sometimes be dangerous to be a young black male. the sta statistics areoverwhelming some aspects of crime. overrepresentation of our prison population of young men of color. it's just -- it is historically dangerous to be a young black man in america. and it's no different for me than it is for, you know, for anyone. my age and race. >> bill: i understand that does the fact that reported crime, not convicted crime, reported crime so overwhelmingly tilts toward friend men mitigate this that reported crime. mostly by other for instance, all for for african-americans. dot that mitigate anything. >> i don't believe it does. you have to look at the it culture which this bias is held. you have to look at the imagery of the culture andwhat the popular culture has turned out in terms of the representations of people of color. look, whenever you have majority population, and, you know, the united states of america is in the middle of a huge shift in terms of the makeup of its population, racially whch you have a majority population. the majority is always going to set the rules. and it -- and our case black people have traditionally pa bit actually, institutionally been disenfranchised and targets of law enforcement more than any other group. >> bill: i have to run. i want to talk to you about this again. i want you to do research for me. i think it's a fact that proportionally young black men commit far more crimes than any other group in this country. i think that's what is driving all of this fear on both sides. mr. burton, very good conversation. >> um. >> bill: we will pick it up. >> we will talk again,bill. we will talk again. >> bill: plenty more as the factor moves along this evening. jim carrey apologizes to gun owners for the comments. adam carolla has thoughts. putting leisure activities putting leisure activities ahead of serious issues.

do you do that? >> well, the federal aviation administration is responsible. the ntsb investigates accidents where a separate organization. but the faa does have in country experts and some countries and they may send people to travel to other countries. but they do have to work with their counterparts to make sure standards are upheld. >> bill: sure i'm wondering what the oversight is in the faa and your agency to make sure these guys know what they are doing. let me give you an example, i flew in the 1990s on air vietnam most harrowingexperience, ducks walking up and down the plane. it was crazy. i would never get on another vietnam plane back then. i'm sure they have upgraded now it was a dangerous experience. the salvadorian airline during the salvadorian war was crazy some didn't even have radar. when i see a plane crash like this and the guy didn't have much experience on the 7777 even though there were four pilots, weighs in command, that makes me nervous. >> well, i think in all of these accidents we have to look at all of the facts before we reach conclusions. it's just been a couple of days. we do know a lot about the flight from the cockpit voice recorder. the flight data recorder. it is important for us to look at pilot qualifications that's going to be a part of our investigation. we conduct very thorough investigations and our team is actually in the process of interviewing those pilots today. >> bill: you don't have any sway over what south korea does. that's my point here. now, on the front of these planes coming into theu.s.a., do the pilots have to all speak english, right? they all have to speak english, correct? >> sure. and just to go back, the faa does have some sway. they have to get operating authority to come into the united states. they have to meet certain standards to do that. >> bill: but nobody knows if they do or not. that's my point. but the english, let's stay on that. all the pilots have to speak english, right? >> english is the universal language when it comes to aviation. all pilots around the world and air traffic controllers do communicate in english in order to have that commercial operations. >> bill: because i know on the voice recordered there is korean on that recorder as well as english. is there not? >> that's right. when the crew is talking to each other, they may be talking in their native language. when they are talking to air traffic control, those communications are required to be in english. >> bill: all right. terrible thing. and you know, there is nothing we can do. flight safety record in the united states is beingexcellent so we want everybody to know that don't panic. i just wanted to find out the oversight of the rest of the world. appreciate you coming on tonight. we know you had a busy day. bernie goldberg said president obama and secretary of state kerry was goofing around when ♪when you experience something great, you want to share it. with everyone. that's why more customers recommend verizon, america's largest 4g lte network.>> bill: thanks for staying with us, i'm bill o'reilly. in the weekdays with bernie segment tonight. criticism by some in the media that secretary of state and president obama were involved with trivial pursuits instead of play paying attention to the blow up in egypt. >> i don't know how this happened it was terrible optics. the next day the president goes golfing and secretary kerry is out on his yacht. what does that say to young people in egypt across the middle east part of the debate about america's interest in the region? >> bill: is that criticism justified? joining us now from north carolina the purveyor of bernard goldberg.com about mr. goldberg. we have eaten this before not only in president obama with bush the younger, dwight eisenhower golfing, while the sof soviets are moving across poland whatever. justified? >> i think the analysis that you just played is absolutely correct. the optics are terrible. the president of the united states of america isplaying golf in short pants and a polo shirt while one of the most important countries in the arab world is unraveling, yeah, that's a bad picture. but, i don't think those optics were a mistake as bad as they were. i don't think it was mistake. president obama was sending a message to president morsi and the message was, i never liked you, i don't like you now. in many ways you are worse than mubarak, the dictator that you succeeded and playing golf says: i am not going to lift a finger. i'm not going to say a word publicly that will save you from being thrown out. so i think that's one strong possibility. the second one has absolutely nothing to do with diplomacy or politics. and it's pretty simple, bill. i think it may actually be the real reason. president obama just lane likes playing golf. i don't think it's possible that he is going to say i'm not going to let some crisis in cairo interruptmy golf dame game especially on a long holiday weekend. >> bill: kerry likes his yacht out in nantucket. they like their leisure time. they work hard. they are entitled to it however, however, when you get a president who whose management style is under fire and it is, certainly, i was talking to mort zuckerman the publisher of the new york daily news not a conservative newspaper about the president's management style. and the message he sends not just to the egyptians but to kind of the world is, you know what? ah, it doesn't really matter, it just doesn't matter. >> i think you are absolutely right. i mean, he really does lead from behind. that's why the optics are so bad. i'm not sure that whether he was on the golf course or in the situation room of the white house would have made one bit of difference on the ground. >> bill: it wouldn't have. >> on the ground.but, it doesn't look good and it sends a message that we don't care enough about what happens in your country that i'm going out to play golf. so, it doesn't look good for the president. i want to get back to the fact that i don't think it was an accident. i don't think optics are necessarily an accident when it's at that level. i think he was saying i'm aloof and i am not getting involved in this one. don't forget, a lot of critics have said over the past year or so that president obama never spoke out publicly about the excesses of president morsi. so now that it hits the fan and it's going south, you think he's to be in the middle of that? he would rather be out on the golf course than in the middle of that. >> bill: i think it's more than just egypt though. it looks to me and this is pure speculation. it looks to me that the president says, you know what? i won twice. i don't have to run again. i'm going to do what i want. if i want to play golfwhile morsi is, you know, in some dirty cell in cairo, i don't care. i think you are right. he doesn't care about morsi. play a little golf. because, what's it to me? >> let me tweak that just a little bit. i think this is somebody who wanted very badly to be president of the united states. but i don't think he likes having to do the job of president of the united states. that's sort of a drag, you know? i mean, you have got to do all this stuff that a guy like obama doesn't really like. i think he really is too cool for school very much of the time.

because the rules are so complex. >> i have an accountant. >> you don't want to do it yourself. >> i have no idea and i promise this is true. >> he does my taxes. i don't want to pay him but i have to

wendell holmes once said taxes are what we pay for a civilized society. liberals like to cite that but he said that in 1927 when taxes were just 10 percent of gdp. that is enough to pay for a civilized society but government has grown so far far, so fast it is now spending 40 percent of gdp. is too big but i do want to to pay my fair share.what is fair? i now give most of my income to the government. pork people pay a smaller percentage of those say that's fair. budget congressmen louie gohmert says it is not fair and that means what? >> when people hear the word fair share it should be a flat tax the only way to truly make things fair so that if you make more you pay more make it a flat tax the president -- president has talked repeatedly about warren buffett not paying their rate as the secretary. fix it. make capital gains 15 or the income tax 15. we can work out a number but make it flat to make it fairyou hear people say i want it fair but they cannot tell you what the fair share is. you give them the numbers of the top 1 percent making 13 percent of the many that paying 39% of the taxes the eyes crossover but is it fair with everybody paid the same rate across the board? they say yes. i think americans are ready. john: i am skeptical providing most would say warren buffett has billions of dollars, he should pay more than i do. >> that is absolutely right to. he should pay more. john: i need a higher percentage. >> that would be progressive and that plays into people's jealousy. i don't want to go after millionaire's more than anyone else. we need a flat tax. people don't mind if you would see they don't have all the deductions and wiggle room and would be inthe same position as everyone else. john: when you talk about the flat tax you talk about getting rid of deductions and just keep charity and mortgage interest deduction. >> everything else is gone. if you would design a system that would allow maximum corruption, maximum lobbying efforts and fund-raising in washington you created a system just like we have for it is so complex, we have got to fix it. it cannot keep going like this. >> that the complication is with the stupid deductions and exceptions of graduated progressive tax rate is not that complicated. >> the way the wealthy have not been fighting so hard against the progressive right is they have the loopholes and the wealthiest will stop fighting so hard if they have the same levelplaying field as everyone else and people would except that the leadership has not been willing to push it and i think it is a no-brainer we should push it. john: thank you congressman t. levin steve forbes and are laugher and those who have pushed from before me. john: we will hear from him later. what i hate even more is the complication. i resent i have to pay bob for the hours he spends doing my tax forms. but i have to because there is no way i could do mine on my own. the federal tax code is 70,000 pages long. 70,000 pages. this is just what the fed does and state and local does more. they all have some purpose to penalize behavior coming anchorage and other but the results is insanity that helps the politically connected.people in the know like me. the tax rules once gave me a free tax -- golf cart because john -- charlie rangel said it was a good thing. >> energy efficient cars such as plugging in a car. >> they could advertise free cars. >> for $6,000 get a $6,000 tax credit. i got this totally free. >> but the taxpayers paid for its. >> and i gave it away. and that credit no longer exists but things like that keep the tax code complicated this is just the income tax. there are sneaky taxes that most of you may not even know about that. >> we pay them all day long from the moment i wake up and turn on the light. i pay more when i brush myteeth, license my dog, my building pays property taxes and when they leave home to take the subway i paid the metropolitan commuter one negative commuter tax. i make phone calls or get a bite to eat, soda and drink drink, when a gas up my car as much as one-quarter of the price is the state and city excise taxes. people pay sales taxes all day long. so many taxes. i need a drink. i am lucky i don't smoke. this is one reason american economic growth has stalled says scott hodge president of the tax foundation. when i think of these rules i think of safety regulations and the constant spiderweb not the tax code. we have done okay with the tax code.>> the tax code is a mess because of the 70,000 pages that dictate virtually every aspect of our lives and cost americans 6 billion hours of our time just to comply. six out of 10 of us pay someone else because not only so complicated we are afraid to make a mistake to get audited. it has created fear as well as complexity. john: so those six out of 10 could have used that money and time to boost the economy to do something useful? >> i is called deadweight loss. it cost $200 billion per year just to comply with the 70,000 pages of tax regulations that is why the economy grows so slowly. john: they are popular. steering people to good things, solar panels on the roof of your house to get a credit if you adopt a child child, congress passes thesethings because people say that is fair. >> they sound great by themselves but if you put them together it creates a complicated mess to dictate every aspect of our lives and made the irs with the super agency where we put our kids in day care to a hybrid vehicle. john: why is it nuts if you want people to put kids in day care that need the help or to buy a hybrid vehicle how else do you steer them there? >> is years the economy in the wrong direction why the economy grows so slowly because we dictator lives to the tax system not what is economically efficient or profitable. that is what drives the economy and with other countries have done to streamline their tax system like hongkong. 15 countries across the globe have moved to the flat tax.hong kong has so low rate, a broad base no negative tax or capital gains or other taxes that create the economic inefficiency. john: to be clear they don't have a flat tax but it is a simple tax. russia, estonia have 15 or 20 percent flat tax. >> exactly. john: hong kong women from poor to rich in a few years. they grew out of poverty because of simple rules. >> that made them one of the most business friendly economically efficient countries on the globe. john: the tax foundation says we have no deductions? >> there are a few there are some like having a deduction for savings we should not tax back or capital gains but get rid of the politically directed. john: charity? >> the tax the nation is acharity under the tax code but i would give that up for the flat tax. john: billing to give up money for the flat tax to do know the irs used your tax dollars to produce a ""star trek"" parity? >> it has resulted in a widespread case of confusion >> the secret tax is a obamacare and people who profit from the complex tax code. >> the affordable care act means big changes this year when you file your taxes. when you file your taxes. i read the whole 900 pages. [ birds chirping ] i'm your hot water heater. you hardly know i exist. that's too bad. 'cuz if my pressure relief valve gets stuck...

image that supposedly is the tax hike on the wealthy. if you make over $250,000 your medicare tax you pay a premium zero point* 9%. it goes up by almost 1% then there is a tax on investment of three point* 8%. john: obamacare it has the high medical bill tax? >> right now you can deduct medical expenses if they are over seven point* 5% of your income but obamacare raises the threshold that 10 percent so you are sick with high medical bills next year you cannot deduct nearly as much money. john: and the mandate penalties that says i will not insure my people i will just pay the penalty. >> it is the tax.>> the supreme court says it is a tax. the penalty tax will raise about $50 billion over 10 years and penalties paid by businesses who don't buy insurance. you have to or pay the penalty. john: we just cover four or five out of 20. it is so complex h&r; block made a commercial to capitalize on the complications of obamacare. >> be affordable care act means big changes when you file your taxes. i read the whole 900 pages. i will give you a tax and health care review. i know the law. i have the solutions and can help you figure it out. john: she is smiling. a big grin. i invited h&r; block to talk about the gloating but they did not respond. they are happy becausecomplexity we have to pay them. >> this turbochargers tax complexity. you have to figure how much subsidy you are due in did you don't buy insurance homage of a penalty you pay. that is really complicated if you have an insurance gap of three months or less you don't but if it is more you do. if it is an exempt category you don't have to do either. it is so complicated that the application form is 21 pages long because they need to know how much income. john: i hate it. most americans have to go to someone they do not do the taxes on their own. thank you. john merline from ""investors business daily."" a new version of star trek?paid for by the irs, bayou. you will not believe what they do with your money. >> with the planned attacks according to the leaders they have created an arkie chaos roll over order. ♪set it off like a score alert ♪ beep beep what?

With Judge Jeanine : FOXNEWS : February 3, 2013 12:00am-1:00am EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"well. greg think it is dorky, but going well on itunes. >> i would help you with the styte tells. >> i am doing 12 of >> judge jeanine: i don't love guns. i don't necessarily like guns. i'm a city girl. more comfortable in high heels than boots. and although i had a pet pig for 20 years, that is wilbur right there, and worked in a dairy as a kid, i own guns. long guns. handguns. i own guns because it is my right. it is not a right any one in washington gave me. it is a natural right. confirmed by the very people who founded this nation. it is a right that no one is going to take away from me. hello and welcome to ""justice."" i'm judge jeanine pirro. this week the debate continues injuries the rhetoric more heated as parents in newtowntestify about innocent children taken from them. as sheriffs across this country threaten the arrest of any federal agent who would enforce unconstitutional gun laws as police chiefs support the ban on assault rifles, politicians threaten gun manufacturers and the very banks that fund them and as gun associations sue to protect their guns. cachophony of voices louder and louder at times drowning out the issue on which we all agree, stopping the senseless slaughter of innocence. the president wants to ban assault rifles. he wants to limit high capacity magazines, do background checks and close gunshow loopholes. the truth? banning weapons to prevent crime doesn't work. no where is that point more evident, mr. president than in your hometown chicago where in spite of the ban on handgunsmore people were murdered in the last decade than the number of americans killed in afghanistan. and afghanistan is a war zone. last month in your home city with one of the toughest gun laws in the nation, 42 people including that 15-year-old majorette who performed at your inauguration were murdered. and of those murdered in chicago in the last decade less than 1% of them were killed with a long gun. so i guess that handgun ban isn't working out so well. the bottom line, criminals get guns. law abiding citizens get killed. why would you give the criminals an advantage over an unarmed citizenry? hell, why not just post a map like the journal news did and identify where people without guns live. and rahm emanuel. another member of that chicagooutfit has the huztpah to threaten banks. you say that chicago is leading the effort to keep communities safe? rahm emanuel, what standing do you have to lead any anti-gun initiative? your city is the murder capital of america. leading the way? where are you going to lead them to? you want to stop law abiding citizens from owning guns while at the same time the obama administration was sending free assault rifles to the mexican drug cartels that they then use to kill us. and here in new york mandatory jail time if you are arrested with a loaded gun. loaded illegal gun. sounds good. the problem? fewer than half of those arrested for illegal possession of loaded handguns even received a state prisonsentence. mandatory all right. unless a judge doesn't think they are. you you could drive an 18 wheeler through that old interest of justice excuse to not jail someone. and now the president wants to have a dialogue and mental illness. we know the virginia tech shooter and the colorado movie theater shooter and the gabby giffords shooter each had serious mental problems or were declared to be dangerous. even the newtown shooter who played violent video games for days on end had mental problems. it is interesting that the president mentioned nothing about violent images and video games. if we ban assault rifles then shouldn't we ban the images of assault rifles in movies and video games? what is that you say? the first amendment protects free speech? of course, it does. and the second amendment protects my right to bear arms.neither trumps the other. and by the way, what is with this proposed mental illness database? who should be in it? the mentally ill? the mentally defective? those with a criminal record? those likely to engage in crime? those involuntarily committed? the ones on psychotropic drugs. many states don't even report federal convictions let alone reportal health data. i don't want to forget hppa. my healthcare system so to locked down my other mother's doctor won't even tell me somehow she is doing. we need to prosecute gun crimes. we need to contain the dangerously mentally ill where they are shooting people, killing them, killing them with cars or pushing them on to subway tracks. i have fought for civilconfinement of the dangerously mentally ill. i didn't say mentally ill. i didn't say homeless. the supreme court of the united states has said that civil confinement of the dangerously mental ill is constitutional. kansas versus hendricks. go look it up. i have been in the trenches for decades. i have seen what criminals can do. the pain of those affected by those massacres s palpable through all of us. but law abiding gun owners did not pull those triggers. the founding fathers were forward thinking enough to sea we have the right to bear arms. they didn't say a musket or a rifle with a bayonet. they said arms. i have a natural god given right. i don't have to explain whether i'm hunting deer or defending myself. who should say that i can only defend myself with a certain number of bullets?should i empty my clip and just wait for the end? i have the right to protect my family and myself. i don't love guns. but one day i know i may need them. with me now is syndicated columnist and political commentator ann coulter and fox news contributor pat gudel. good evening, guys. >> good evening. what an opening. >> judge jeanine: am i right or am i wrong? >> needless to say i agree with every syllable of it and to add to it your point of it it being a natural god given right. that is the point of the constitution and all of the liberal law professors, at the university of texas and most recently kale lamar at yale university keep saying oh, no, this is a right for the militia. they say sorry i'm a lebron ral i wish this weren't true.but the right of the people mean exactly as you say. a right that preexisted the constitution and the constitution is merely acknowledging. >> judge jeanine: and saying we are not going to infringe upon it. pat? >> we have a revolution. we passed the second amendment. people knew why they had guns. that was how they protected themselves is from tyranny is what they believed. it was so clear what was meant. the militias, everyone in the villages. the arguments against. what we have here is for a long time people who are anti-gun who think they are evil have been trying to undermine the second amendment. what i love is when the aclu as a friend of mine once said, oh, i know you people, you are the people for all of the bill of rights except the second amendment. >> judge jeanine: right, right. >> this is a de facto way to try to get at that. i never understood the argument. it is ridiculous. >> that is why you are our favorite democrat. >> it is the historical truth. that's all.>> i thought you would go back to your democratic roots on this one. >> judge jeanine: maybe he is going back to his constitutional roots and whether we are republicans or democrats. this stuff from rahm emanuel from the mayor of chicago when says and pat, what do you think of this guy? the city of chicago is leading the effort to fight guns. are are you kidding? he should take care of what is in your own backyard. >> this man has a rolling ongoing massacre of young children in chicago. it is worse than any city without any gun control in america. and he can't do anything about it. so what he does and this is the the rahm emanuel remember who said those famous words never let a good crisis go to waste. and what we have people pulling off the shelf everything they have been trying to do without solving the problem. and hissing about after the banks in the typical style of what i call chicago gangster politics, we will go after anybody and promote anythingexcept he can't stop the violence and killing in his own city and he is going to lead the actual effort? >> judge jeanine: why do you think that is? i was a judge and a prosecutor. you commit a crime you should go to jail. what is going on in chicago? >> they are not allowing the law abiding people to arm themselves for one thing. there are dangerous ghettos in chicago. >> rahm emanuel shows up with the bullet proof glass and says nice to visit your neighborhood now, i'm going home. >> judge jeanine: we know where the crime is occurring in chicago. on the south side. the gang members, why is this girl sitting in a park at 2:00 in the afternoon being gunned down. they know this. why aren't they doing something? >> liberals don't have a very good record on dealing with crime. that being the case is citizens out to be able to arm themselves the same way up a emanuel's body guards are armed. >> somebody is not stopping the gang violence.we had it when i lived in l.a. they still have it. not at the level of the deaths going on here. and of children. and yet they are unable to either prosecute, put away or deal with or change the circumstances. if i were the mayor that is what i would be involved in. >> judge jeanine: what about this idea that the president has about the mentally ill. let's do a database of the mentally ill. we don't even know in new york half the people in jail are mentally ill and we are letting them out. >> it is the right target. completely the wrong remedy. >> judge jeanine: how do you do it? >> the way we did it up until 30 years ago there was civil commitment. the book the insanity offense and it has laid out clear guidelines of exactly what happened in america 30 years ago when first california and then the rest of the states started ended civil commitment. the homeless rate went through the roof. we are seeing that. >> judge jeanine: we are worried about the nut jobs they let go.>> the homicide rate has gone down. the number of massive shootings has gone through the roof exactly as we have is an explosion of homeless people. we are talking about the mentally ill. >> we went too far are in deinstitutionalizing. that was an instinct we shouldn't keep people locked up. some people need to for their own protecon and their own life. >> their harm more than -- >> it is about what they -- he won't speak about hollywood or video games because of the money and i hope we deal with that. >> judge jeanine: it is appalling. ann, pat, thanks for being with us. the new york rifle and pistol association and the westchester county association filed a complaint against the state of newark regarding the new strict 2013 again law and will there be a fight if the feds try to enforce new gun laws. two of the country's toughest lawmen coming up. and later live on the scene ofthe alabama hostage standoff. hostage negotiators hard at work trying to free a five-year-old boy. stay with us. in america tay we're running out of a vital resource we need to compete on the global stage. what we need are people prepared for the careers of our new economy. by 2025 we could have 20 million jobs without enough college graduates to fill them. that's why at devry university, we're teaming up with companies like cisco to help make sure everyone is ready with the know-how we need for a new tomorrow. [ male announcer ] make sure america's ready. make sure you're ready. at devry.edu/knowhow. ♪ at devry.edu/knowhow. all right that's a fifth-floor probleok.. not in my house! ha ha ha!ha ha ha! no no no! not today! ha ha ha! ha ha ha! jimmy how happy are folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to geico? happier than dikembe mutumbo blocking a shot. get happy. get geico. fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more.>> judge jeanine: this is a fox news alert. on the ongoing hostage situation in midland city, alabama where a five-year-old boy continues to be held in a secure underground bunker. reports are that jimmy lee dykes the man accused of holding the boy has allowed police to deliver coloring books, medication and toys forhim. that, of course, a good sign. we will be live on the scene later in the show to bring you the latest on the negotiations. police working very hard to free this boy and return him safely to his parents. now, back to guns. the obama administration is pushing to restrict gun ownership. if that happens will those laws even be enforced? sheriffs in 39 states say they will not only not follow the laws, they believe that those laws will violate the second amendment. with me are are maricopa county arizona sheriff joe arpaio from phoenix and ken christian is sen from santa fe. thanks for being with us. >> thank you. >> good to be with you, judge. >> judge jeanine: you not only believe that the proposed federal gun regulations are unconstitutional but youindicated that you will not allow federal agents to come to your state to enforce those laws. why is that? >> well, judge, we are are not going to enforce those laws and we are is certainly going to do everything we he can to protect the citizens of new mexico. i am extremely proud of the sheriffs from the new mexico sheriff's association that stood up with me in the capital earlier last month and stated that we would not enforce those laws. >> judge jeanine: and sheriff arpaio you have been called the toughest sheriff in america. what do you think we he should do to get illegal guns off the street? >> we should enforce the laws if it is illegal, protect the constitution. throw some extra years at people that use weapons in the commission of the crimes. and be vigilant. don't ignore information you get from people that are going to do havoc like in the recentsituation in connecticut. i sent out my volunteer armed posse over 500 to patrol the schools and by the way, i have the third largest sheriff's office in the country with 4 million people with thousands of federal agents. i don't think i'm going to lock up federal agents but i'm not going to knock on doors to take guns away from private citizens. >> judge jeanine: sheriff, do you think that that is what the so-called federal gun grab is? it will be a door are to door search for illegal guns? >> i don't know about regular guns. i worry about the ban on semi automatics because there s a ban if congress passes that are we going to worry about the feds saying we are going to knock on every door and recover all of those rifles? i am never going to do it but i have a little -- i worry a little about that happening. so we have to fight back. protect the constitution. and make sure that we do the --we follow the constitution and that s what this sheriff is going to do. and i have to give appreciation to the other sheriffs. in all we have 3,000 sheriffs in this country. so i have to say that a few of the sheriffs are are coming out like in new mexico. i wish all of the sheriffs would come out on this matter. >> judge jeanine: and sheriff christiansen do you think there is a difference between urban and more rural areas in terms of the breakdown as to whether or not law enforcement believes that the ban on assault weapons or proposed ban is legal? >> i do. i think in the cities it is another problem all together. but in the country and urban areas it is a different situation. sheriff joe is right and by the way you hit it right on the head in your opening about everything that sheriffs are talking about across this country. you know, these federal agentsthat people talk about, they are friends of mine. many of them are friends of mine and they also took an oath. they are not coming to anybody's house taking guns away. i'm afraid these laws are just not going to been forced. we had plenty of laws right now that aren't being enforced on a daily basis. >> judge jeanine: and what is interesting is that all of you took an oath to support the constitution of the united states and the laws and constitution of your individual states. it will be a very interesting showdown. but hopefully it won't even be a showdown. anyway. thanks for being here. >> thank you. >> thank you. >> judge jeanine: coming up a wisconsin sheriff says you you better arm yourself because 911 might not save you. he is with us.   and later, that heart breaking hostage situation continues in alabama. we will bring you the latest. stay with us.♪ ♪ call 911 shorty on the dance floor, whoa ♪ >> judge jeanine: one milwaukee sheriff is making a bold statement about 911 not being your best option. take a listen. >> with officers laid off and 911oughed simply calling and waiting is no longer your best option. beg for mercy, hide under the bed or fight back but are you prepared? consider taking a certified safety course and handling a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there. you have a duty to protect yourself and your family. we are are partners now. can i count on you? >> judge jeanine: the milwaukee county sheriff david clark, jr. thanks for being with us this evening. >> judge, it is my pleasure. >> i have to tell you that is avery interesting psa, public service announcement. what caused you to actually do that announcement? >> well, the back drop is this. we had severe public safety cuts both the city of milwaukee police department and the milwaukee county sheriff's office. we had rising response times. 52 minutes to respond to a burglary. this is through no fault of the officers. a lack of political commitment by the elected leaders in wisconsin who have abandoned not only the street officer is but the citizens as well. the concept that an individual doesn't play a critical role in their own protection is foreign to me, as a matter of fact. personal safety s an individual responsibility. part of my job is to give people the honest truth of what is going on and i have operationallized two important things that have gone on in the state of wisconsin recently. a doctrine that protects home owners in their home should anintruder come in and the personal protection act which allows citizens to apply for a permit and arm themselves. >> judge jeanine: interesting. most people think -9d 1 911 ise end all. i was looking at the lawsuits where the police haven't been a dispatched or one person calls after he has been shot. 7 minutes later he calls again he has been shot and now he is is running down the highway and then heard being shot to death. i mean cases like that are not unusual. but no one has taken the stand that you have which is let's level with the citizenry and in fact i think that it was your mayor who said something like do we have a sot on that? no, we have the full screen. apparently sheriff david clark is auditioning for the next dirty harry movie. hthat is the mayor. what say you to that one? >> i wasn't surprised. i was hoping to hear somethingcoherent and logical for the mayor. he s part of the reason why that the area is in the plight that it is. you know, judge, that personal safety is not a passive activity. we need to engage citizens and the more we empower people to play a role in their own personal safety the better community milwaukee is going to be. >> i assume, sheriff, when we talk about a ban on assault rifles and a ban on handguns like in chicago and washington that is not something that you are in favor ever? >> not at all. i trust law abiding is citizens. i trust law abiding citizens to go armed. what i fear, judge, is a criminal perpetrator with a gun. what i fear is a lenient prosecutor's office and a lenient judiciary who will not enforce vigorously the laws on the books that will send a different message to the criminal element that that kind of activity is not going to goon. >> judge jeanine: i want you to take a look at this homeland security video real fast. the department of homeland security says what we should do if a mass murderer comes in. do we have that one, guys? >> if you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available. to protect your hiding place lock the door if you can. block the door with heavy furniture and close, cover and move away from windows. hide behind large items such as cabinets or desks. >> judge jeanine: sheriff, if you heard it they said grab scissors. i mean are you kidding? this is the department of homeland security and they are worried about people defending themselves with guns. sheriff clark i assume that you don't think grabbing a scissor is a good idea if someone is coming at you with a gun? >> i saw that the other day and i laughed. dhs is out of touch. i like to think that i have my finger on the pulse of what goes on at the street level with both the officers and thecommunity. again, i'm not afraid of empowering citizens to make critical decisions and i don't want to sit here and tell people in this situation do this and in this situation do that. that is whew i emphasize it is an individual responsibility. people have to make the best determination with what they are are faced with on the ground when the situations arise. the thought of grabbing scissors in that situation i think is laughable. >> ridiculous. i will say it for you. sheriff clark, i couldn't agree with you more. thanks for being with us. we would love to have you on again. >> judge, it is my pleasure. >> judge jeanine: do gun buybacks work? vote on facebook or on twitter @ judge jeanine. and a new segment on justice. creep of the week. our first creep is rashaud green of ohio. this upstanding citizen's ex-tried to get a restrainingorder against him in domestic relations court. now, as you can see from the video the magistrate who i will get to in a minute leaves green alone with the woman seeking the order and his grandma and that s when things go to hell in a hand basket. green chases her around the room, knocks her to the ground and starts pelting her. and because i can't help myself, that magistrate tracy stoner who isn't a real judge s my sub creep of the week for leaving them alone in the first place. who is dumb enough to do that? but alas only one creep of the week. rashaud green congrats on being the first to take top honors. my viewers will decide what your prize should be. send me a message on facebook or tweet me at judge jeanine and let me know what you think rashad's prize should be. and coming up we are live from the scene of the dramatic host and situation in alabama.   and later, benghazi was badenough and now other u.s. embassies may be in danger. sometimes what we suffer fromis bigger than we think ... like the flu. with aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. so why treat it like it's a little cold? there's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. prescription tamiflu attacks the flu virus at its source. so don't wait. call your doctor right away.tamiflu is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. before taking tamiflu tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. if you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking tamiflu and call your doctor immediately. children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. the most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. the flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about tamiflu. prescription for flu. that your mouth is under attack, from food particles and bacteria. try fixodent. it helps create a food seal defense for a clean mouth and kills bacteria for fresh breath. ♪ fixodent, and forget it. c'mon0manp just do it.ú no one's watchingp ♪musicú ♪musicúgood job   live from america's news headquarters i'm lauren green. this time tarlgiting a top social media, twitter reveals 250,000 accounts were cracked open, exposing e mails and private pass words. the company has reset the stolen pass words. earlier in the week ""new york times"", washington post and ""wall street journal"" reported their own systems had been hacked. just days before president obama heads to minnesota to discuss gun controlz the white house release aid photo showing the president shooting at clay targets on a range at camp david. gun rights advocates say one picture does not erase hisrecord of supporting legislation. i'm lauren green, now back to justice with judge janine. judge. >> judge jeanine: this s a fox news alert. the standoff continues in alabama where jimmy lee dykes continues to hold a five-year-old boy hostage in an underground bumpinger. let's go now to the -- bunker. go to garrett on the scene in midland, city, alabama with the latest. what is the latest? what is going on there? >> reporter: good evening, judge. authorities are continuing to release very few details about exactly what is happening there at the bunker. in fact, the press conference we were expecting to happen here in about 30 minutes was just canceled. and that has really been kind of typical the last few days. earlier today police did tell us that they have been in constant communication with the 65-year-old man jimmy lee dykes who they say shot and killed a bus driver before taking a special needs child down intothe underground bunker on tuesday afternoon. we are here on another chilly night. the fifth night that the child has been down there. police told us earlier that dykes is helping to keep him warm with electric blankets and heaters he has down there and also allowed police to deliver some toys and coloring books to the young child as well as medicine and potato chips they just told you us. they are grateful for that that he is helping to teak care of the child and keep him in good health but they are are still hoping to reach some type of resolution. the next update we are expecting will be tomorrow morning. and also happening tomorrow is the funeral for the bus driver how many in this community are calling a hero for dying while trying to protect the kids on his bus. >> judge jeanine: garrett, let me ask you a quick question here. is there any relationship between this jimmy lee dykes and the child that hekidnapped? >> authorities have not told us anything about that relationship, if there is any. we still don't know. that is one of the many details we are waiting to hear. exactly why it is that this would happen. we do know that jimmy lee dykes was scheduled to go into court on wednesday. >> judge jeanine: for what? >> for some -- he was scheduled to go there for menacing with neighbors. lots of the neighbors we talked to people here as well as in the community said he wasn't the ideal neighbor. people called him just a mean man. he is very protective of his property from what neighbors have said. any time someone or an animal would get close to the property lines he would either fire a gun into the air or become very aggressive and near violent with them. so that s what he was going to be in court for on wednesday. we don't know if that is related. authorities have not said. again we are still waiting to find out many of these things and frankly many of them we probably won't find out untilafter this whole thing s resolved. >> judge jeanine: garrett, thanks so much. with me now is former fbi lead international hostage negotiator chris voss from d.c. and former hostage negotiator scott wagner are with me here in new york city. chris, it is day five. what is taking so long? >> well, they have to show him that the they patient. i'm sure he has a vision of a possible negative outcome by authorities rushing in and attacking him or assaulting him in some way. they are reassuring him and showing him that they have all of the patience that is necessary. they will hear him out. the fact that he has taken all of the defensive measures and this is all about him being very defensive indicates that he would just as soon live if he could. and it is just a matter of them ultimately reassuring him and earning his trust so that he comes out. >> judge jeanine: we just heard scott from the reporter thatthis child is eating potato chips. i mean do we have any idea why this particular child? >> well, not that we have been made aware. we have the president has been kind of held at a standstill as to what has been going on. we do know that the individual has accepted medications that the child is needing. and that is a good sign. >> judge jeanine: i understand that he suffers from aspergers which is at one end of the autism syndrome. >> that is what s reported, yes. >> judge jeanine: you are a negotiator. what do you say in a situation like this? five days. >> as long as we are are talking and we are communicating that means it is positive. the situation hasn't had to escalate at all. it is basically at a stable position right now. they are are talking. and as long as people aretalking -- >> judge jeanine: 80s' good. he is antigovernment and antiauthority. >> apparently. but then again he -- we don't know what his fears are. we don't know what his demands or wants or needs are. in order to negotiate with someone in anything you have to know what they want. what are their wants. >> judge jeanine: chris, do we know what he wants? >> well, ultimately what he wants s to be left alone. and all of the things that he is against it is amazing the amount of things that that is the starting point for conversation because you could find out what happened to him, why he is against those things. you you begin to ask him questions about well if you are against this what are you for on the other side. so as much as we know about him it is amazing how much there s actually to talk about this and find out what really makes this guy tick. >> judge jeanine: one of the things that we know, scott, is that they are not allowing the parents to talk to the child. we do you think that is? >> the negotiators have to control the setting and the screen. >> judge jeanine: this poor five-year-old. he is a baby.>> when you introduce the parents or any unexperienced person into a setting like this you could and tate unwillingly or unknowingly. you don't know he what issues the is subject has with his own mother or his own father or his own parents. obviously he is aware that he did something wrong. >> judge jeanine: he killed a bus driver. >> he is aware of what he did and that is in the past, its' done. now, what's done is done, let's move on and now let's work through the situation where nobody gets harmed. >> judge jeanine: chris, last question to you. how long can this go on? you know, without the jimmy lee dykes doing something, i mean how long does law enforcement wait? is there an answer? >> open-ended. law enforcement is going to wait for as long as it takes. there is no reason for them to go anywhere. they are not having any trouble controlling the scene. they will do whatever is takes to save this little boy's life.>> judge jeanine: let's hope that that happens. thanks for being with us this evening.   coming up, in the wake of benghazi and the attack on the embassy in turkey, how safe are our embassies around the globe? and later, you won't want to miss what sean smith's mother has to say about hillary clinton. or that printing in color had to cost a fortune. nobody said an all-in-one had to be bulky. or that you had to print from your desk. at least, nobody said it to us. introducing the business smart inkjet all-in-one series from brother. easy to use. it's the ultimate combination of speed, small size, and low-cost printing. yeah, i'm looking to save, but i'm not sure which policy is right for me.you should try our coverage checker. it helps you see if you have too much coverage or not enough, making it easier to get what you need. [ beeping ] these are great! [ beeping ] how are you, um, how are you doing? i'm going to keep looking over here. probably a good idea. ken: what's a good idea? nothing. with coverage checker, it's easy to find your perfect policy. visit progressive.com today.this week another attack on a u.s. embassy. this time in ankara turkey that left an embassy guard dead. the latest attack along with the benghazi massacre and reports that security at our embassy in afghanistan may not be sufficient begs the question. is this administration turning a blind eye to the safety of our diplomats. with me is former cia operative mike bake fres baker from boisdphares. are are our embassies under a greater threat now than ever before? >> they are certainly under a greater threat not because of the inner ring meaning the protection of the embassies. what walls should we build, how many security guards. that is uniform across the web of our embassies but because of the outer ring. who are the enemies. in libya for example the idea that the militia that were not really considered 80s enemies were the ones who attacked us should raise a flag and in other places around the world what the u.s. government needs to do s to understand what are the networks at play. in turkey, for example it is not just the local left wing militia that i would be concerned about but the penetration coming from iran and syria. so the outer ring seems to need growing in threat against u.s. embassies for private institutions for that matter. >> judge jeanine: and mike there is a report that says aprivate security company hired by the state department to protect american diplomats at arguably the most at risk u.s. embassy in the world failed to adequately train employees and on and on. does that surprise you, mike? >> no. i hate to say it doesn't necessarily surprise me. and i agree with whalid that we are currently looking at a much more dangerous environment for u.s. facility is overseas. it has always been dangerous whether talking about the tower bombings or the east africa embassy bombings, karachi, beirut. i would argue that the past four years sort of our policy is particularly in the middle east and asia have created inconsistencies and sort of emboldened i think some of those hostile against us. the report that you are tacking about in kabul unfortunately over the past ten years because of iraq and because of afghanistan in particular we had to rely more on privatesecurity companies and also local personnel. >> judge jeanine: mike what you are saying s if we rely on private security companies we are paying them and if we know that the host company in the february 17 brigade in benghazi could care less and are are infiltrating, why don't we is send our own guys there? what s that about? >> i'm saying this as an owner of a large information security company and i have had a lot of experience in some of these locations. but when you are talking about running a private security company you are talking about the bottom line. adding mo more people and adding more training and adding more quality eats into the bottom line. that is a problem. what we should be doing and should have done years ago given our time spent in iraq and afghanistan is we should have been looking at the military as let's build up not just the marine security guard program but you a separate cad ray also charged with protecting some of the high threat areas in a more robustway. >> and whalid one of the things that hillary clinton said as we stepped down yesterday she implemented all of the arb recommendations. do you buy it? >> the enemy knows all of these recommendations. the jihaddists are not dumb and they understand how we protect ourselves. in the area where the embassies fortresses they willres they not send a brigade to attack us head on. not just the inner wall we need to look at but the strength and capacity of the enemy in striking in different countries. ail geary it was not even protected and we had citizen there's. we need to have a more intelligent intelligence in the situation. >> judge jeanine: no doubt. thanks for being with us this evening. >> thank you. >> judge jeanine: coming up, her son was killed in benghazi and now sean smith's mother responds to hillary clinton'stestimony. this is america. we don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. so if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and then treats day afr day... block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first place![ male announcer ] e pill eachmorning. 24 hours. zero heartbur>> judge jeanine: and now this week's in stam insta poll. do gun buyback programs work? most of you are not buying it. laurel says watch we may have another fast and furious out of all of the buybacks. >> joe says yeah to go by a newer and better gun. jack says if the intent s to retrieve legal guns from legal gun owners it probably works to the extent of disarming grandma and grandpa and all of the liberals know that these cranky old fools shouldn't be armed. car sarcasm intended. and tim p. says yes to some degree. any gun you get off the street is one less that can murdersomeone in the hands of a crazy person. is it enough? no. the problem is too great. eileen says yes as you you have is some grenade launchers you want to unload. otherwise it is a waste of time and money. i'm with you, gun buyback programs do work. i ran a gun buyback program when i was d. a. but you nbuer saaw you anything like this one. a missile launcher turned in during a gun buyback program in seattle. one less miss is sill launcher on the street. don't you feel better now?

welcome everybody. good to have you. good luck getting folks to leave home. not if a new study says welfare related benefits are topping $38,000 in several states. that doesn't mean that everyone getting welfare is lazy. but i trust a good nanny can do math. the math doesn't make it all that compelling to get off the couch. to ben stein, melissa francis, along with adam lashisty. charles, what do you make of this? >> i talked about this a long time. i've been blasted on comedy central for being heartless. the fact of the matterers i'veseen it in my own eyes. >> medal of honor, wow. >> they figured out what we already know about you. >> all right. >> john, go ahead. you were saying. >> the bottom line is it's just, listen, we should be making it where people are urged to get off welfare instead the idea of making it comfortable. i've always said they made poverty comfortable enough not to get off of it. it's not the one where they pay for the house, food, rent, cell phone and sit at home and make a lot more money than people doing minimum wage jobs. it's simple math and it crushed generations of people. crushed them. >> it does make it tough to leave that because even if it isn't exactly the same, child care issues, it doesn't have to be. it's daunting. >> in new york, especially. you receive the benefits, of course, you're not getting taxed. in new york, you have to make $21 an hour in order to takehome the same amount of money as if you were on all these programs. and then i mean because they're talking about a single mom with two kids, you also have to find someone to watch your kids. so it's just impossible. the real thing is then you have no incentive. how are you going to go from a total stand still of having no job at all to leaping up to a job where you make more than $21 an hour? that's impossible. >> you have to make sacrifice and transition. >> that's what people have to be incentivized to understand. the first step you take an economic hit. now you're in the system. now you work your way up the system. it's a hard sales pitch. >> whatever happened to the welfare to work program? >> welfare reform, right? in the early 1990s, you had all the great thinkers, people saying we need to change the system. we need to incentivize people to go to work. deincentivize people to stay home and collect welfare. in five years, barack obama has essentially changed that. we are now going away from -- >> this trend has been going on through the bush administration, as well.but i guess this time -- it's a bipartisan sort of a rant here. benefits are out of control. ben stein, here's what i heard from a lot of folks who were noting fox is condemning this new trend. well, obviously for reason to dramatically hike if not double the minimum wage. what do you make of that? >> well, that's a good way to double the unemployment rate. i mean the situation is very difficult for poor people. we can just start at the beginning and say if you're a poor person, if you're a person who does not have much education or much ability to earn money, you're screwed no matter what you're doing. you're not going to live well on $38,000 a year. you're not going to live well on $21 an hour. you have to go back farther and start explaining to people they must get education. education is the capital from which people build careers, lives, homes, families. that somehow has to be drummed into people's heads. we don't know how to do it.we don't know how to do it. >> i don't think we should be incentvising people to do this stuff that puts them into welfare. >> having kids, starting a family -- >> that's one of the problems. you get paid more money when you have more kids. >> go ahead. >> ben was starting to make an important point which is we sort of -- >> then i guess he did. >> i'm going to finish. >> all right. >> we overgeneralize. ben said it's hard to have a good life on $38,000, especially in some of the states that we showed on screen. we're also overgeneralizing here. these programs are not a bed of roses. it's not like you sort of lounge around eating bon-bons. and the check shows up. they check up on you every day. >> what, go out and do push-ups every day? you get the money, dude.you have to enroll in the program. you have to participate. you have to check in, et cetera. >> oh, come on. >> if we're saying that our public policy should be to encourage people to work, to not work, i completely agree. by the way, i think most people who were on welfare would rather have a job, would rather have that good feeling that you get from working. that's absolutely what we should encourage. >> i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. i hope that is the case. what worries me is we live in a society where at least some of the major protests over the last year have been for government aid and benefits and not for jobs. >> exactly. or to skew the pay system somehow so that the kid who drops out in tenth grade can be rewarded at the expense of someone who worked their way through college. i have to disagree with adam. the way it works, it's not just one person in the house over $38,000. there are two or three brothers and a mother. soon the household income gets around $70,000, $80,000. people can buy $200 sneakers. let's talk about the real world for a minute. deincentivize. how do you do it? i know too many people who dropped out of school won't take a job at mcdonald's. they tell me flat out. they want to work.they want outlandish salaries. for their skill sets. >> how difficult is it to get into the programs? >> you can get a new phone almost every month. go back to the program with a new cell phone. >> fill out a few papers. that's a big thing is absurd. >> the bottom line is the benefits are very generous. they're getting more generous to adam's point. i don't think they're life sustaining. they're clearly not. i think it's very hard to breakaway when they get so generous and to your point on childcare issues, you actually can make a very good math argument not to, right? >> you can make a fantastic math argument not to. it's impossible to go from that stand still to having a job where you make more money. like everything else, it goes back to parents trying to teach kids the only way they get ahead and sustain a middle class life is to get out there and get the first job and get promoted and get the n one and work their way up. they have to accept that no matter what you can get for free, it is not as much as can you do on your own. you have to be willing to work hard.>> i'm sorry, ben. charles wrote a brilliant thing about this in his book and experience growing up in harlem. it does get to be a cycle, doesn't it? >> it's generational. it's a shame. it's sold as a way of caring for people when, in fact, at some point you're not caring for them because you're enabling something that -- see, the idea that people won't ever live the american dream or attempt to is heartbreaking. it is called subculture poverty. sociologists have been talking about for years. if you incentivize people to do things, they keep them in poverty. like having kids out of wedlock, they stay in poverty. >> i know. but it's not realistic we're going to break this cycle any time soon. any time you talk about changing this, what are you going to take the food out of the single moms with kids? no one is ever in favor of that. any time you want to cut back on programs -- >> rudy giuliani did. >> so if that is the case then ben stein, where are we going with this? >> we're in real trouble.americans are not acquiring human capital in the form of education and skill sets to use charles' very wonderful phrase that is going to build this country and build up self-esteem and self-worth of the people of this country. we have a whole culture that's not starving but it's starving for self-esteem. they resort to violence, drug addiction, premarital and extramarital sex. we have a whole culture that is just dying from lack of self-esteem and that's from lack of work. >> people like him perpetuating it, right, adam? >> i know you don't want to comment on that for me. >> i don't, indeed. stick around, we're going to take a break.   in the meantime, no way to the nsa. why the lawmakers are saying the best way to defund the agency right now. the ""cashin' in"" crew is all over it at the bottom of the hour.   one of the largest stock exchanges stopped cold for threehours. they're calling it technical difficulties. when i first felt the diabetic nerve pain, of course i had no idea what it was. i felt like my feet were going to sleep. it progressed from there to burning... to like 1,000 bees that were just stinging my feet.

>> well, the only way that there would have been something like this happening if there was the crisis and lots of live human traders and they the question -- >> that happens sometimes. >> the question we have to ask, it could happen. ask us how much better off are we with the computer system? i don't know that there has been any data showing we are better and there is more liquidity and prices are lower for the investor. for the very long run, stocks are certainly a heck of a lot better than the ordinary investor. >> but does it inhibit trading? you don't see it in volume figures, but could it inhibit trading? >> listen, it could be really bad. by the way, studies all over the place on net net, which is better the humans or the computers. yes, they'll say more liquidityand you can trade easier so it's better. but execution and all these other factors go into what are stock prices. i will say this, though. i think the nasdaq did a great job with the big guys. they did a great job talking wall street and they did a great job with the regulators and dealt with the issue pretty well. like put a cork in it very well. they dealt very well with their big customers and list of companies. >> two e-mails. >> you got two e-mails. >> i guarantee the apple people were on the phone. >> i'm telling you, it's how in 2001 and the computer has just started taking over here. >> but it hurts the retail guy. that's who really got screwed here. the average investor sits back and says, why am i in stock? i'm not a guy that pumps stocks up, but doesn't take a rocket scientists to figure out it went from 6 to 15 in a couple years. if you were out of it, you missed making a lot of money. >> we like to have people think at home it does take a rocketscientist. >> it actually doesn't. >> well, that's good. >> when we come back, the people working here can learn from this college sophomore in atlanta. still listening, washington?
